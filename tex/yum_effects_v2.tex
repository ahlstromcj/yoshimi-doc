\section{Effects}
\label{sec:effects}

   The \textsl{Yoshimi} \textbf{Effects} panel provides a number of special
   effects that can be applied to parts.
   Effects are, generally, black boxes that transform audio signals in a
   specified way. More exactly, the only input data for an effect in
   \textsl{Yoshimi} is an array of samples.
   The output is the transformed array of samples.

   As described, effects have no information about anything else. For
   example, key presses are not recognised. Therefore, pressing a key does
   not initiate the LFO. Phase knobs will always be relative to a global LFO,
   dependent only on the system time.

   \textsl{Wetness} determines the mix of the results of the effect and its
   input.  This mix is made at the effects output. If an effect is wet, it
   means that nothing of the input signal is bypassing the effect. If it is
   dry, then the effect has no effect.

   \textsl{Interpolation}
   means that, if one MIDI-learns the controls, one can now automate them
   smoothly instead of the somewhat gritty previous behaviour.
   This does not change processor demand when running at 64 frames, a short
   number of frames.
   This interpolation is especially effective on "saw" sounds with the
   frequency control on the EQ low pass filter.


   The \textbf{Effects} panel is shown in
   \figureref{fig:yoshimi_main_screen}.
   Note that these effects have been incorporated into a separate
   guitar-effects project called \textsl{Rakkarrak} \cite{rakarrack}.

   There are two types of effects: System effects and Insertion effects.
   Insertion effects have a sub-type for part effects. The effects themselves
   behave in the same way but with slightly different 'outer' controls.

   The System effects apply to all parts and allows one to set the amount of
   effect that applies to each part. Also, it is possible to send the output
   of one system effect to another system effect. In the user interface this
   is shown as "source -\textless destination". For example:
   The \textbf{0 -\textless 1} knob controls how
   much of the system effect 0 is sent to system effect 1.

   Insertion effects are described in
   \sectionref{subsubsec:effects_paneltypes_insertion}.

   All of these effects can also be managed by \textsl{Yoshimi's} NRPNs\newline
   For details, see \sectionref{subsection:effects_nrpn_values}

\subsection{Effects / Panel Types}
\label{subsec:effects_paneltypes}

   There are three variations of Effects sub-panels:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{System Effects}. (up to 4 effects)
      \item \textbf{Insertion Effects}. (up to 8 effects)
      \item \textbf{Part/Instrument Effects}. (up to 3 effects)
   \end{itemize}

   Here are the major elements of the main effects panel, which shows the
   System and Insertion effects tabs.

   sub-section.

   The next sub-sections show the variations on the effects panels.

\subsubsection{Effects / Panel Types / System }
\label{subsubsec:effects_paneltypes_system}

   The first variation
   appears when one enables an effect in the
   \textbf{System Effects}
   panel of the main \textsl{Yoshimi} dialog.  It contains the standard
   controls for the given effect, plus the following interface items
   (as previously described).

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
%   \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{2.1.0/system_effect_example.png}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{2.3.0/system.png}
   \caption{Sample System Effects Dialog}
   \label{fig:sample_system_effects_dialog}
\end{figure}

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{Effect number}
      \item \textbf{Effect name}
      \item \textbf{On}
      \item \textbf{Send To}
      \item \textbf{C}
      \item \textbf{P}
   \end{enumber}

\subsubsection{Effects / Panel Types / Insertion }
\label{subsubsec:effects_paneltypes_insertion}

   The second effects variation
   appears when one enables an effect in the
   \textbf{Insertion Effects}
   panel of the main \textsl{Yoshimi} dialog.
   It contains the same standard controls for the given effect, but with
   a different header containing the following interface items.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
%   \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{2.1.0/insertion_effect_example.png}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{2.3.0/insertion.png}
   \caption{Insertion Effects Dialog}
   \label{fig:insertion_effects_dialog}
\end{figure}

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{Effect number}
      \item \textbf{Effect selection}
      \item \textbf{To}
      \item \textbf{C}
      \item \textbf{P}
   \end{enumber}

   There are up to 8 Insertion effects available. These are each applied to
   one part or to the master output and one may use more than one insertion
   effect for one part or the  master output. If using more than one effect,
   the effects with smaller indexes will be applied first (first, insertion
   effect 1 occurs, then
   effect 2, and so on).

   \setcounter{ItemCounter}{0}     % Reset the ItemCounter for this list.

   \itempar{To}{effects!to}
   Send the Effect To.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{bottom-panel/instrument-edit/Effects/part-selection-dropdown.png}
   \caption{Part Selection Dropdown}
   \label{fig:sample_part_selection_dropdown}
\end{figure}
   The first option sends the effect to the main L/R outputs rather than
   just one part.
   \index{insertion effect!master out}
   Note that if \textsl{Yoshimi} is set for 32 or 64 parts, the dropdown list
   will be extended to include them.

\subsubsection{Effects / Panel Types / Instrument }
\label{subsubsec:effects_paneltypes_instrument}

   There is also a "part" or "instrument" effects window which is accessed
   by going to the main window, clicking the \textbf{Edit} button in the
   bottom panel to open the edit dialog, and then clicking the
   \textbf{Effects} button there.

   The part effects window has the same layout as System and Insertion effects;
   it is now almost identical to Insertion effects, but there are only 3 effects
   available for for each part. There are the standard controls for the given effect,
   plus the following interface items.

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{Effect number}
      \item \textbf{Effect selection}
      \item \textbf{To} (part-selection-dropdown.png)
      \item \textbf{C}
      \item \textbf{P}
      \item \textbf{Bypass}
      \item \textbf{Close}
   \end{enumber}

   "To" Values: \texttt{Next Effect* , Part Out, Dry Out}\\
   \\
   The default is to pass each effect (combined with the incoming signal) on to the next,
   forming a daisy chain of effects.\\
   If it is set to Part Out, it breaks the chain and blocks any higher numbered effects.\\
   If it is set to Dry Out, it sends the incoming signal component directly where part
   effects are added together, so it won't be passed on to later effects. However, the
   output of the effect itself \textsl{is} passed on to later ones. Consequently, if this
   effect is bypassed it also effectively bypasses all later ones.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{2.3.3/effects.png}
   \caption{Sample Instrument Effects Dialog}
   \label{fig:sample_instrument_effects_dialog}
\end{figure}

   \index{effects!bypass}
   Note the extra \textbf{Bypass} check-box.  If the \textbf{Bypass} item is
   checked, then the effect is not used; it is taken out of the circuit.  This
   user-interface item only appears if one clicks the \textbf{Edit} button for
   a Part, and then clicks the \textbf{Effects} button in the \textbf{Edit}
   window.

   Also be aware that the layout of some of the effects dialogs have been modified
   in the latest revisions of \textsl{Yoshimi}.
   This dialog form is reversed (top and bottom) compared with very old
   \textsl{Yoshimi} versions, and slightly simplified in appearance. This was done to
   more closely match the layout of the System and Insertion Effects.
   Also, in the actual effects, some control positions and sizes have been changed
   to improve readability.

   From here on we only show the effects inserts themselves, as they are identical
   across Part, Insertion, and System. The only difference being \textbf{D/W} becoming
   \textbf{Vol} in System effects. Also, note that EQ has a \textbf{Gain} control
   instead of \textbf{Vol}

   All effects (apart from EQ) also have a panning control, which behaves in the same
   way as everywhere else, permitting the effect to appear to have an off-center position.

\subsection{Effects / Upgrade}
\label{subsec:effects_upgrade}
   Since V 1.5.11 there is an indication that effect controls have been altered. As can
   be seen, the normal black text of the preset selector becomes a strong blue.
   This colour change will also apply to any effects that have been saved.
   \begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{2.3.0/effects_warning.png}
   \caption{Effects Edit, No Effect}
   \label{fig:effects_warning}
\end{figure}

   This change will take place if one alters any of the controls after a preset has been
   selected. The rationale here is that one can make such changes, then save the
   Instrument/Patchset that this effect is in.
   When re-loading, one would be quite likely to forget that changes have been made and
   experimentally switch to different presets or even different effects.
   Previously, at this point those changes have been lost and one might be puzzled that
   the sound has changed (possibly quite subtly) when returning to the same preset.

   With the new upgrade one is warned about this. It even applies when loading very old
   Instruments and Patchsets as the effects are checked against the known defaults as
   they are installed.

\subsection{Effects / None}
\label{subsec:effects_edit_none}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{2.3.0/no_effect.png}
   \caption{Effects Edit, No Effect}
   \label{fig:effects_edit_none}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Effects / DynFilter}
\label{subsec:effects_edit_dynfilter}

   A dynamic filter is, as the name says, a filter which changes its
   parameters dynamically, dependent on the input and current time. In
   \textsl{Yoshimi}, frequency is the only variable parameter. It can be
   used as an "envelope following filter" (sometimes referenced "Auto Wah" or
   simply "envelope filter").

\subsubsection{Effects / DynFilter / Circuit}
\label{subsubsec:effects_edit_dynfilter_circuit}

   Though this filter might look a bit complicated, it is actually easy. We
   divide the parameters into two classes:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Filter Parameters are the ones obtained when one clicks on Filter.
         They give the filter its basic settings.
      \item Effect Parameters are the other ones that control how the filter
         changes.
   \end{itemize}

   The filter basically works like this: The input signal is passed through a
   filter which dynamically changes its frequency. The frequency is an
   additive of:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item The filter’s base frequency.
      \item An LFO from the effect parameters.
      \item The "amplitude" of the input wave.
   \end{itemize}

   The amplitude of the input wave is not the current amplitude, but the so
   called "Root Mean Square (RMS)" value. This means that we build a mean on
   the current amplitude and the past values. How much the new amplitude
   takes influence is determined by the Amplitude Smoothness (see below).

   RMS value plays an important role in the term \textsl{loudness}.
   A fully distorted signal can sound 20dB louder due to its higher RMS value.
   This filter takes this into account, depending on the smoothness.

   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{zyn/effects/dynamic.png}
   \caption{Dynamic Filter Circuit Diagram}
   \label{fig:dynfilter_circuit_diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Effects / DynFilter / User Interface}
\label{subsubsec:effects_edit_dynfilter_ui}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
%  \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{bottom-panel/instrument-edit/Effects/effects-edit-dynfilter.jpg}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{2.3.0/dynfilter.png}
   \caption{Effects Edit, DynFilter}
   \label{fig:effects_edit_dynfilter}
\end{figure}

   This figure shows the Part/Instrument variation of the DynFilter sub-panel.
   The System/Insertion variation has the following elements.

   \begin{enumber}
      \item \textbf{Preset}
      \item \textbf{Filter}
      \item \textbf{Vol} (system/insertion) or \textbf{D/W} (part/instrument)
      \item \textbf{Pan}
      \item \textbf{Freq}
      \item \textbf{Rnd}
      \item \textbf{BPM}
      \item \textbf{LFO Type}
      \item \textbf{St.df}
      \item \textbf{LfoD}
      \item \textbf{A.S.}
      \item \textbf{A.M.}
      \item \textbf{Inv.}
   \end{enumber}

   The five controls in the middle of the middle panel
   (\textbf{Freq}, \textbf{Rnd}, \textbf{BPM}, \textbf{LFO Type}, and \textbf{St.df})
   control the LFO.

   BPM is new from \textsl{Yoshimi} V 2.1.0 and locks the frequency control to the
   incoming MIDI clock. See \sectionref{subsubsec:bpm_and_frequency}\ for further details.
\iffalse
this was changed quite a few versions ago and is no longer true
   In \textbf{DynFilter}, the \textbf{Gain} control, and most of the formant
   filter ones only operate as one \textsl{releases} the mouse button, and the
   scroll wheel cannot be used at all.  Investigating, it was found that this
   was specifically done because these controls create significant noise when
   adjusted, and effects are real time, so that's a lot of noise. (When filters
   are applied elsewhere, the result is next-note so one doesn't hear the
   changes).

   Which is more desirable:
   (1) Noise when ever the control is moved, scroll wheel capability and fully
   responsive GUI;
   (2) Noise only when the control is released, no scroll wheel, filter graphs
   only updated on control release.
   To be determined.
\fi

   \noindent \textbf{NOTE:}\\
   One should be aware that DynFilter sets its own (quite different) default values for
   almost all the actual filter controls. For VocalMorph1 and VocalMorph2 this includes
   the formant elements themselves:\\ Per vowel, Per formant! This became more obvious
   with the default indication provided since V 2.3.0

   Let's start with the user-interface elements present in the
   System/Insertion variation of this effect.

   \setcounter{ItemCounter}{0}      % Reset the ItemCounter for this list.

   \itempar{Preset}{dynfilter!preset}
   DynFilter Preset.

\end{figure}

   Values: \texttt{WahWah, AutoWah, Sweep, VocalMorph1, VocalMorph2}

   \itempar{Filter}{dynfilter!filter}
   DynFilter Filter.

   This small button brings up Filter Params stock sub-panel item.
   This stock user-interface item is shown and described in
   \sectionref{subsubsec:filter_parameters_user_interface}.

   \itempar{Vol}{dynfilter!volume}
   DynFilter Volume.

   Values: \textsl{0 to 127}

   If the effect is used as a System effect, then this control appears.

   \itempar{D/W}{dynfilter!dry/wet}
   DynFilter Dry/Wet Mix Setting.

   Values: \textsl{0 to 127}

   If the effect is used as an Insertion effect, then this control appears.
   "Dry" means the unprocessed signal and "wet" means the processed signal.

   \itempar{Pan}{dynfilter!pan}
   DynFilter Panning.

   Values: \textsl{0 to 127}

   After the input signal has passed through the filter, Pan can apply
   panning.

   \itempar{Freq}{dynfilter!lfo freq}
   DynFilter LFO Frequency.

   Values: \textsl{0 to 127}

   \itempar{Rnd}{dynfilter!lfo randomness}
   DynFilter LFO Randomness.

   Values: \textsl{0 to 127}

   \itempar{LFO Type}{dynfilter!lfo type}
   DynFilter LFO Type.

   \itempar{St.df}{dynfilter!lfo stdf}
   DynFilter LFO.
   Left/right channel phase shift. Towards the extremes 'widens' the sound.

   \itempar{LfoD}{dynfilter!lfo depth}
   DynFilter LFO Depth.
   This control sets the degree to which the LFO modifies the amplitude.

   \itempar{A.S}{dynfilter!a.s.}
   DynFilter A.S.
   A.S sets the Amplitude Sensing (i.e. how much influence the amplitude
   shall have).

   \itempar{A.M}{dynfilter!a.m.}
   DynFilter A.M.
   Changes the rate at which the amplitude changes the filter. The higher
   one sets this value, the more slowly will the filter react.

   \itempar{Inv.}{dynfilter!a.inv}
   DynFilter A.Inv.
   If set, negates the (absolute) RMS value. This will lower the filter
   frequency instead of increasing it. Note that this will not have much
   effect if the effects input is not very loud.

\subsection{Effects / AlienWah}
\label{subsec:effects_edit_alienwah}

   AlienWah is a nice effect done by Paul Nasca. It resembles a vocal morpher
   or wahwah a bit, but it is more strange. That's why he called it "AlienWah"
   The effect is a feedback delay with complex numbers.

   The AlienWah effect is a special, dynamic formant filter.
   Paul Nasca named it AlienWah because it sounded "a bit like
   wahwah, but more strange". The result of the filter is a sound varying
   between the vocals "Ahhhhh" (or "Uhhhhh") and "Eeeeee".

\subsubsection{Effects / AlienWah / Circuit}
\label{subsubsec:effects_edit_alienwah_circuit}

   No diagram, just a description of AlienWah.

   Hint: Keep in mind that Effects that can be controlled by LFO can also be
   controlled arbitrarily: Set the LFO depth to zero and manipulate the phase
   knob (e.g. with NRPNs or maybe via OSC in the future).

   The way that the filter moves between the two vocals is mainly described
   by an LFO. Paul Nasca has stated the - slightly simplified - formula (for
   i2 = -1 and R \textless 1) as:

   \[fb=R*(cos(a)+i*sin(a))\]

   \[yn=yn-delay*R*(cos(a)+i*sin(a))+xn*(1-R).\]

   The input xn has the real part of the samples from the wavefile and the
   imaginary part is zero. The output of this effect is the real part of
   \texttt{yn}.
   \texttt{a} is the phase.

   AlienWah Preset.

   Values: \texttt{AlienWah 1, AlienWah 2, AlienWah 3, AlienWah 4}

   \itempar{Phase}{alienwah!phase}
   The phase of the AlienWah.
   See \texttt{a} in the above formula.
   This lets one set where the vocal is between
   "Ahhhhh" and "Eeeeee".

   \itempar{Vol}{alienwah!volume}
   AlienWah Volume.

   Values: \texttt{0 to 127}

   The volume control is present in this effect when used as a System
   effect.

   \itempar{D/W}{alienwah!dry/wet}
   AlienWah Dry/Wet.

   Values: \texttt{0 to 127}

   The \textbf{Vol} control is replaced by this control if the effect is
   used as an Insertion effect.

   \itempar{Freq}{alienwah!lfo frequency}
   LFO Frequency.

   Values: \texttt{0 to 127}

   Determines the LFO’s frequency in relative units.

   \itempar{Rnd}{alienwah!lfo randomness}
   LFO Amplitude Randomness.

   Values: \texttt{0 to 127}

   Part of the LFO definition.

   \itempar{BPM}{alienwah!lfo sync}
   Locks the frequency control to the incoming MIDI clock. New from
   \textsl{Yoshimi} V 2.1.0 See
   \sectionref{subsubsec:bpm_and_frequency}\ for further details.

   \itempar{LFO type}{alienwah!lfo shape}
   Set the LFO shape.

   Values: \texttt{SINE, TRI}

   Part of the LFO definition.
   Note that the LFO in other contexts has ramps and exponential shapes that
   are not present here.

   \itempar{St.df}{alienwah!phase diff}
   AlienWah Left/Right Channel Phase Difference.

   Values: \texttt{0 to 127}

   Part of the LFO definition.
   Sets the phase difference between LFO for left/right channels.
   \textbf{St.df} lets one determine how much left and right LFO are phase
   shifted.  64.0 means stereo, higher values increase the right LFO
   relatively to the left one.

   \itempar{Dpth}{alienwah!depth}
   LFO depth.

   Values: \texttt{0 to 127}

   \textbf{Dpth} is a multiplier to the LFO. Thus, it determines
   the LFO's amplitude and its influence.

   \itempar{Delay}{alienwah!delay}
   Amount of delay before the feedback.

   Values: \texttt{1 to 100}

   If this value is low, the sound becomes more of a "wah-wah" effect.

   \itempar{Fb}{alienwah!feedback}

\subsection{Effects / Chorus}
\label{subsec:effects_edit_chorus}

   In a chorus, many people sing together. Even if each of them sings at
   exactly the same frequency, all their voices usually sound different. We
   say they have a different timbre. Timbre is the way we perceive sound and
   enables us to tell the difference between various music instruments. This
   is, physically, achieved by varying both the amplitude envelope and the
   frequency spectrum. Multiple sounds with slightly different timbres make a
   sound more shimmering, or powerful. This is called the chorus effect.

   The chorus effect can be achieved by multiple people singing together. In
   a concert, there are many instruments, resulting in the same effect. When
   making electronic music, we only have an input wave and need to generate
   these different timbres ourselves.
   \textsl{Yoshimi} therefore simply plays
   the sound, pitch modulated by an LFO, and adds this to the original sound.
   This explains the diagram below: The multiple pitches are generated by a
   delayed version of the input. This version is being pitched by an LFO.
   More detailed, this pitch is generated by varying the reading speed of
   the delayed sound; the variation amount is controlled by an LFO.

   Related effects to Chorus are Flangers. Flangers can be described as
   Chorus with very short LFO delay and little LFO depth. One can imagine a
   flanger as two copies of a sound playing at almost the same time. This
   leads to interference, which can be clearly heard. It is popular to apply
   flangers to guitars, giving them more "character".

\subsubsection{Effects / Chorus / Circuit}

\end{figure}

   First, crossover is applied.
   The \textbf{Freq}, \textbf{Rnd}, \textbf{LFO Type}, \textbf{St.df},
   \textbf{Depth} knobs control the LFO
   for the pitch. If the depth is set to zero, the pitch will not be changed
   at all.

   Delay is the time that the delayed sound is delayed "on average". Note
   that the delay also depends on the current pitch.

   After the correct element of the sound buffer is found using the LFO, the
   Fb knob lets one set how loud it shall be played. This is mostly redundant
   to the D/W knob, but we have not applied panning and subtraction yet.

   Next, the signal can be negated. If the \textbf{Subtract}
   checkbox is activated, the amplitude is multiplied by -1.

   Finally, \textbf{Pan} lets one apply panning.

\subsection{Effects / Distortion}
\label{subsec:effects_edit_distortion}

   Distortion means, in general, altering a signal. Natural instruments
   usually produce sine-like waves. A wave is transformed in an unnatural way
   when distortion is used. The most distorted waves are usually pulse waves.
   It is typical for distortion to add overtones to a sound. Distortion often
   increases the power and the loudness of a signal, while the dB level is
   not increased. This is an important topic in the Loudness War.

   As distortion increases loudness, distorted music can cause ear damage at
   lower volume levels. Thus, one might want to use it carefully.
   Distortion can happen in many situations when working with audio. Often,
   this is not wanted. In classical music, for example, distortion does not
   occur naturally. However, distortion can also be a wanted effect. It is
   typical for Rock guitars, but also present in electronic music, mostly in
   Dubstep and DrumNBass.

   The basic components of distortion are mainly

   \begin{itemize}
      \item A preamplifier.
      \item The waveshaping function.
      \item Filters.
   \end{itemize}

   Preamplification changes the volume before the wave is shaped, and is
   indeed the amount of distortion. For example, if one clips a signal, the
   louder the input gets, the more distortion one will get. This can have
   different meanings for different types of distortions, as described below.

   The filters are practical. A reason for using them afterwards is that
   distortion can lead to waves with undesired high frequency parts. Those
   can be filtered out using the LPF. A reason for using filters before
   applying is to achieve multiband distortion.

   The topic of types of distortion is discussed in the
   Oscillator Section.

   Note that one can use the Oscillator editor in order
   to find out what the distortion effect does. Also note that while the
   Oscillator editor’s distortion is limited to some oscillators one can
   produce in the Oscillator editor, the distortion effect can be used on
   every wave that one can generate with \textsl{Yoshimi}.

\subsubsection{Effects / Distortion / Circuit}
\label{subsubsec:effects_edit_distortion_circuit}

   We explain the functionality in a diagram and list the components below.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.333]{zyn/effects/distort.png}
   \caption{Distortion Circuit Diagram}
   \label{fig:distortion_circuit_diagram}
\end{figure}

   Negation is the first thing to happen. If the \textbf{Neg Checkbox} is
   activated, the amplitude is multiplied by -1.

   \index{distortion effect!panning}
   Panning is applied. Note, however, that one must activate the Stereo
   Checkbox, labelled \textbf{St}, before it will work.

   Pre-amplification is done next. The amount can be changed using the Drive
   nob. Indeed, this is the amount of distortion. For example, if one clips a
   signal, the louder the input gets, the more distortion one will get. This
   can have different meanings for different types of distortion, as
   described above.

   HPF and LPF are filters with 2 poles. Whether they are used before or
   after the waveshape, depends on the checkbox labeled PF.

   The next step is the wave shape. This defines how the wave is actually
   modified. The Type ComboBox lets one define how. We will discuss some
   types below.

   After the wave shape, we scale the level again. This is called output
   amplification. One can change the value using the Level knob.

   Crossover is the last step. This is controlled by the knob LR Mix and
   means that afterwards, a percentage of the left side is applied to the
   right side, and, synchronously, the other way round. It is a kind of
   interpolation between left and right. If one sets the LR Mix to 0.0, one
   will always have a stereo output.

\subsection{Effects / Echo}
\label{subsec:effects_edit_echo}

   The echo effect, also known as delay effect, simulates the natural
   reflection of a sound. The listener can hear the sound multiple times,
   usually decreasing in volume. Echos can be useful to fill empty parts of
   songs with.

\subsubsection{Effects / Echo / Circuit}
\label{subsubsec:effects_edit_echo_circuit}

   The good circuit diagram is shown in an old printout we have, but the
   current version of the Echo description at
   http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/Doc/ shows a
   junk file.  So Paul Nasca's description will have to suffice.

% \begin{figure}[H]
%    \centering
%    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{zyn/effects/echo.png}
%    \caption{Echo Circuit Diagram}
%    \label{fig:echo_circuit_diagram}
% \end{figure}

   The echo is basically implemented as the addition of the
   current sound and a delayed version of it. The delay is implemented as in
   the picture below. First, we add the delayed signal to the effect input.
   Then, they pass an LP1. This shall simulate the effect of dampening, which
   means that low and especially high frequencies get lost earlier over
   distance than middle frequencies do. Next, the sound is delayed, and then
   it will be output and added to the input.

   The exact formula in the source code for the dampening effect is as
   follows:

   \[Y(t)=(1-d)*X(t)+d*Y(t-1)\]

   where t be the time index for the input buffer, d be the dampening amount
   and X,Y be the input, respective the output of the dampening. This solves
   to

   \[Y(z)=Z(Y(t))=(1-d)*X(z)+d*Y(z)*z-1 <==> H(z)=Y(z)X(z)=1-d1-d*z-1\]

   which is used in \(Y(z)=H(z)*X(z)\). So H(z) is indeed a filter, and by
   looking at it, we see that it is an LP1. Note that infinite looping for
   d=1 is impossible.

\subsection{Effects / EQ}
\label{subsec:effects_edit_eq}

   EQ is a parametric equaliser.
   An equaliser is a filter effect that applies different volume to different
   frequencies of the input signal. This can, for example, be used to "filter
   out" unwanted frequencies. \textsl{Yoshimi}’s implementations follow the
   "Cookbook formulae for audio EQ" (\cite{cookbookeq})
   by Robert Bristow-Johnson.

   On the equaliser graph there are 3 white
   vertical bars for 100Hz, 1kHz, 10kHz.

   \itempar{Band}{eq!band}

   Band lets one choose the passband number. Multiple passbands define one

   \itempar{Freq}{eq!filter freq}

   \itempar{Gain (Filter)}{eq!filter gain}
   The gain of an individual filter.

   predefined gain makes them ineffective.

   \itempar{Q}{eq!filter q}
   The Q (resonance, or bandwidth) of the filter.
   Resonance lets one describe a peak at the given frequency for filters
   with 2 poles. This can be compared to real physical objects that have
   more gain at their resonant frequency.

   \itempar{Stages}{eq!stages}
   Number of additional times the filter will be applied (in

   Values: \texttt{0*, 1, ... 4}

\subsection{Effects / Phaser}
\label{subsec:effects_edit_phaser}

   The Phaser is a special dynamic filter. The result is a sweeping sound,
   which is often used on instruments with a large frequency band, like
   guitars or strings. This makes it typical for genres like rock or funk,
   where it is often modulated with a pedal, but also for giving strings a
   warm, relaxing character.

\subsubsection{Effects / Phaser / Circuit}
\label{subsubsec:effects_edit_phaser_circuit}

   We explain the functionality in a diagram and list the components below.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{1.5.11/effects-drawing-phaser.png}
   \caption{Phaser Circuit}
   \label{fig:phaser_circuit}
\end{figure}

   The audio signal is split into two paths. One path remains unchanged. The
   other one is sent to a delay line. The delay time (the so-called phase) is
   made dependent on the frequency. Therefore, an all-pass filter is applied
   to the signal, which preserves the amplitude, but determines the delay
   time. At the end, both paths are added.

   Yoshimi offers different types of phasers:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Analog and "normal" phasers}.
      Analog phasers are more complicated.
      They sound punchier, while normal phasers sound more fluent. However,
      analog filters usually need more filter stages to reach a
      characteristic sound.
      \item \textbf{Sine and triangle filters}.
      Note that an analog triangle filter
      with many poles is a barber pole filter and can be used to generate
      Shepard Tones, i.e. tones that seem to increase or decrease with time,
      but do not really.
      \item \textbf{The LFO function can be squared}.
      This is only available for the Analog phaser and converts the triangle
      wave into a hyper sine wave. This approximates a triangle for the top
      half, and more rounded sine-like bottom half. The sine squared is simply
      a faster sine wave.
   \end{itemize}

%  TODO: Barber is deactivated, since PLFOtype is only 0 or 1?

   For the normal phaser,
   \figureref{fig:effects_edit_phaser}, below, shows the controls referred to
   in this list of steps.

   \begin{enumber}
      \item First, the LFO is generated.
         There are 4 controls
         (\textbf{Freq}, \textbf{Rnd}, \textbf{LFO} type, \textbf{St.df})
         that define the LFO.
      \item \textbf{Phase} and \textbf{Depth} are added in the usual way.
      \item If \textbf{hyper} is set, then the LFO function is squared.
      \item Next, this modulates the input signal amplitude.
      \item The \textbf{Analog} setting decides whether the phaser is analog
            or "normal".
            For the analog phaser (see the \textbf{Analog} check-box),
            \textbf{L/R} is not implemented.
            Conversely, for the normal phaser, \textbf{hyper} and \textbf{dist}
            are not available.
      \item \textbf{Pan} applies panning to the original input in every loop.
      \item Next, phasing is applied - barber-pole type for \textbf{Analog} only.
      \item Then, based on the setting of \textbf{Stages}, further phasing
            stages are applied.
            For \textbf{Analog} only the \textbf{dist} control sets the amount of
            distortion when applying the phasing stages.
      \item \textbf{Fb} applies feedback next. The last sound buffer element is (after
            phasing) multiplied by this value and then added back in. For the
            normal filter, the value is added before, and, for analog, after the
            first phasing stage.
      \item Finally, the \textbf{Sub.} option inverts the signal, multiplying it
            by -1.

\subsection{Effects / Reverb}
\label{subsec:effects_edit_reverb}

   A Reverberation actually expresses the effect of many echoes being played
   at the same time. This can happen in an enclosed room, where the sound can
   be reflected in different angles. Also, in nature, thunder approximates
   reverb, because the sound is reflected in many different ways, arriving
   at the listener at different times.

   In music, reverb is popular in many ways. Reverb with large room size
   can be used to emulate sounds like in live concerts. This is useful for
   voices, pads, and hand claps. A small room size can simulate the sound
   board of string instruments, like guitars or pianos.

\subsubsection{Effects / Reverb / Circuit}
\label{subsubsec:effects_edit_reverb_circuit}

   As mentioned, a reverb consists of permanent echo. The reverb in
   \textsl{Yoshimi} is more complex than the echo. After the delaying, comb
   filters and then allpass filters are being applied. These make the
   resulting sound more realistic. The parameters for these filters depend on
   the roomsize. For details, consider the information about Freeverb.

\subsubsection{Effects / Reverb / User Interface}
\label{subsubsec:effects_edit_reverb_ui}

   The user-interface for the Reverb effect depends on whether it is used as a
   System effect or an Insertion effect. When used as a System effect \textbf{D/W} becomes \textbf{Vol}.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Freeverb is a preset. It was proposed by Jezar at Dreampoint.
      \item Bandwidth has the same parameters for the comb and allpass
         filters, but it applies a unison before the LPF/HPF. The unison’s
         bandwidth can be set using BW.
      \item Random chooses a random layout for comb and allpass each time the
         type or the roomsize is being changed.
   \end{itemize}

   Values: \texttt{Random, Freeverb, Bandwidth}

   \itempar{R.S}{reverb!room size}
   Reverb Room Size.
   The room size defines parameters only for the comb and allpass filters.

   \itempar{D/W}{reverb!dry/wet}
   Reverb Dry/Wet Setting.
   This setting controls how much of the original signal is mixed with the
   reverb effect.

   \itempar{Pan}{reverb!pan}
   Reverb Panning.
   Pan lets one apply panning. This is the last process to happen.

   \itempar{Time}{reverb!time}
   Reverb Time.
   Set the duration of late reverb.
   Time controls how long the whole reverb takes, including how slowly
   the volume is decreased.

   \itempar{I.del}{reverb!initial delay}
   Reverb Initial Delay.
   The initial delay (I.del) is the time which the sounds need at least to
   return to the user.

   \itempar{I.delfb}{reverb!initial delay feedback}
   Reverb Initial Delay Feedback.
   Sets the initial delay feedback.
   The initial delay feedback (I.delfb) says how much
   of the delayed sound is added to the input.
   It is not recommended to use this setting together with
   low initial delays).

   \itempar{BW}{reverb!bandwidth}
   Reverb Bandwidth.

   \itempar{E/R}{reverb!e/r}
   Reverb E/R.
   Early Reflection (not currently implemented).

   \itempar{LPF}{reverb!lpf}
   Reverb Lowpass Filter.
   This filter is applied before the comb filters.

   \itempar{HPF}{reverb!hpf}
   Reverb Highpass Filter.
   This filter is applied before the comb filters.

   \itempar{Damp}{reverb!damp}
   Reverb Damp.
   Damp determines how high frequencies are damped during the
   reverberation.  Increasing the setting of the dampening control (Damp)
   progressively 'tilts' the almount of feedback towards lower frequencies.
