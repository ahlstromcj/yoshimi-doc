\section{The Yoshimi Command-Line Interface}
\label{sec:command_line}

   \index{CLI}
   \index{cmd}
   \index{command line}
   \textsl{Yoshimi} provides a command-line mode of operation where almost
   all aspects of the application can be controlled via text commands. This
   mode is useful for blind people, those with motor control problems and for
   programmers, for example. These text commands can also be put into a
   script file, and that script can then be run with full error checking.

   By default, starting \textsl{Yoshimi} from a terminal window will enable
   both the command line and the GUI at the same time. However you can
   specifically disable the GUI at the terminal prompt as you start with:
   yoshimi -i or yoshimi --no-gui

   One of the main features of recent \textsl{Yoshimi} releases
   is improved non-GUI accessibility.  In fact,
   \textsl{Yoshimi} can run with neither GUI nor CLI input access. Working
   purely as a hidden MIDI device, a daemon of sorts. To enable a tidy close,
   there is a new short-form NRPN. Just send 68 to both MSB and LSB (CC99 and
   CC98). If you make the LSB 69, it will return an exit value of 16. This is
   the 'forced exit' and can be used by the system for other cleanups and a
   shut down.

   For full details of NRPNs see
   \sectionref{subsection:nrpns_midi_nrpn_basics}

   In a command line environment, all the 'running' commands are available,
   and now all of the instrument editing ones are too. Also, the whole of
   vector control, and MIDI-learn, is exposed to the command line.

   One can decide what MIDI/audio setup is wanted, list and set roots and
   banks, load instruments into any part, change a part's channel, set main
   volume and key shift, and set up vector control.  A number of first-time
   defaults have been changed to make this feature easier.

   When starting from the command line, an argument can be included for a new
   root path to be defined to point to a set of banks fetched from elsewhere.
   This will be given the next free ID. A future upgrade will allow the ID to
   be set to any valid one when it is created, mirroring the GUI behaviour.

   Once running, all configuration can be done within the terminal window.
   There is also extensive control of roots, banks, parts and instruments
   including the ability to list and set all of these.
   Additional controls that are frequently taken for granted in the GUI, but
   otherwise get forgotten, are \textsl{master key shift} and \textsl{master
   volume}.

   The command-line mode provides extensive error checking and feedback.
   \index{command level}
   The prompt will always show what \textsl{command level}
   one is on, along with relevant information.

   \subsection{Command Depth}
\label{subsec:command_line_command_depth}

   Recent developments in \textsl{Yoshimi} have made it possible to greatly
   (one could say dramatically) extend command-line access deep into the
   synth structures. This creates a problem where the command line itself
   could become unmanageably long.
   Thus, now only the current context level is printed in full. The levels
   higher up the tree are minimised:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi Part 1+>
      yoshimi P1+, Sub>
      yoshimi P1+, Sub+>
      yoshimi P1+, S+, Filter analog>
   \end{verbatim}

   Rather than stating that a switch is on or off, there is now just a
   \texttt{+} sign for "on", and nothing for "off". This is clearer than
   using a \textsl{-}, and the slight shift in the line gives the user
   another visual clue.

   There is a new command in the "config" context that controls where this is
   displayed, or whether it is shown at all.
   This command is:

   \begin{verbatim}
      EXPose {OFF, ON, PRompt}
   \end{verbatim}

   \textbf{Off} will give the bare prompt with no other information.
   \textbf{On} shows it as a separate line above the prompt:

   \begin{verbatim}
           @ P1+, S+, Filter analog
           yoshimi>
   \end{verbatim}

   \textbf{Prompt} shows it as a part of the prompt:

   \begin{verbatim}
           yoshimi P1+, S+, Filter analog>
   \end{verbatim}

   The default setting is \textbf{ON}.

   At the CLI prompt, when effects are being managed, the preset number is
   also shown on the prompt, so one typically sees something like:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi p2+ eff 1 reverb-1 >
   \end{verbatim}

   One will also get a confirmation message.
   Here is an example session:

   Starting from the \texttt{yoshimi} prompt:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi> s p 2 on
      Main Part Number 2
      Part 2 Enable Value 1
      yoshimi part 2+ > s pr 107
      Loaded Smooth Guitar to Part 2
      yoshimi part 2+ >
   \end{verbatim}

   This command \textbf{s}ets \textbf{p}art number 2 to \textbf{pr}ogram
   number 107 from the \textsl{current} instrument bank.
   \textsl{Yoshimi} is now on part 2 as the current part (indicated by the
   prompt), and all subsequent commands will relate to this "level". At this
   level, one can change the current part simply with:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi part 2+ > s 4 on
      yoshimi part 4+ >
   \end{verbatim}

   For clarity we omit the confirmation messages from here on.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} is now on part number 4. Now set an effect:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi part 4+ > s ef re
      yoshimi p4+ eff 1 reverb-1 >
   \end{verbatim}

   This command \textbf{s}ets the part's \textbf{ef}fect 1 (implicit) to the
   \textbf{re}verb type.

   Note that many settings parameters are optional, and if omitted, either a
   default or last-used value will be assumed. Also, names are truncated to
   6 characters so the prompt line doesn't get unmanageably long. From here
   one can set a preset for this effect:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi 4+ eff 1 reverb-1 > s pre 3
   \end{verbatim}

   Since V 1.5.0 the \textbf{pre}sets have been shown in the prompt, and one
   will still get a confirmation message. Also, it used to be necessary to
   enter \textbf{ty}pe for an effect but since V 1.5.10 the name is entered
   directly. Note that when entering effects, there will always be a preset.
   It will be number 1 unless it is changed.

   Many settings that follow in a direct command "path" through several
   levels can be made all at once, and one will be left at the appropriate
   level. Thus, summarising some of the above commands:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi part 4+ > s ef 2 re
      yoshimi p4+ eff 2 reverb-1>
   \end{verbatim}

   A new feature in \textsl{Yoshimi} V 1.6.0 is a warning when an effect
   isn't at the default settings for the given preset. This is in the form
   of a question mark on the end of the line.
   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi p4+ eff 2 reverb-1? >
   \end{verbatim}
   This warning will be there as soon as one changes any of the effect
   controls until either another preset or effect is selected. It will also
   show if a patchset or instrument is loaded that was previously saved with
   altered effects controls.

   One cannot combine \texttt{type} and \texttt{preset} as they
   are both at the same level.

   To go back one level, use the ".." command (reminiscent of the
   \texttt{cd ..} operation in an OS command shell):

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi p4+ eff 2 reverb-5 > ..
      yoshimi part 4+ >
   \end{verbatim}

   To go back to the top command level, use the "/" command:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi part 4 > /
      yoshimi >
   \end{verbatim}

   These two special level-movement commands can also be put on the front of
   any other command.  Starting where we were before:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi p4+ eff 2 reverb-1 > .. s vol 70
      yoshimi part 4+ >
   \end{verbatim}

   Part 4 volume is now at 70, and \textsl{Yoshimi} is once again at the
   "part level", not the "part FX level".
%  Also note that the space after the ".." is optional.

   The help menus and lists are also partially context sensitive. This
   feature should help avoid clutter and confusion.

   As well as an immediate history, \textsl{Yoshimi} maintains a single
   command history file for all instances of \textsl{Yoshimi} that records
   any non-duplicated loads or save.  Thus, provided one makes a normal
   command-line exit, the last commands will be available on the next run of
   \textsl{Yoshimi}.

   The command-line now has formal methods of opening, selecting and closing
   additional instances.

   When loading external files from the command line, there is an alternative
   to entering the full name if \textsl{Yoshimi} has already seen this file
   and it is in the history list. In this situation one enters '@' followed
   by the list number.

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi> l h v

      Recent Vectors:
      1  /home/will/another.xvy
      2  /home/will/Subtle.xvy
      3  /home/will/excellent.xvy
      4  /home/will/yoshimi-code/examples/CoolSound.xvy

      yoshimi> lo ve @4
      Main Vector Loaded /home/will/yoshimi-code/examples/CoolSound.xvy to chan 1
   \end{verbatim}

   The loading of externally-saved instruments is also done, by default,
   relative to one's \textsl{Yoshimi} home directory.  However, saving an
   external instrument from the command-line still requires a full pathname.

   The 'recent history' lists can load MIDI-learned files, patchsets, or
   vector files numerically from the associated list, instead of having to
   type the names out.
   \index{cmd!at-sign}
   This uses the '@' (list number) operator.

   Commands with "*" in the description need \textsl{Yoshimi} restarted to be
   activated.

   Note that \textsl{Yoshimi}'s command-line can also load and save states,
   patchsets, and scales, and can list recent histories. Vector load and save
   is also supported from the command-line. That's a complete vector set,
   with all mappings, instruments, etc.
   One can independently decide which channel to load and save from, so that
   one can actually build up a vector set in (say) channel 3, then later
   decide to use it in channel 7. It has the extension \texttt{.xvy},
   standing for "Xml/Vector/Yoshimi".
   Since V 1.5.9 this has also been integrated with the saved states.

   Another small detail is that all of the minimum command-line abbreviations
   are now \textbf{C}apitalised in the help lists.

   The organisation of these features may be adjusted slightly, based on
   comments from users.

\subsection{Command Level}
\label{subsec:command_line_command_level}

   \index{cli!command level}
   \index{cli!context level}
   A command level (also known as a "context level")
   is simply a position in the hierarchy of commands that cover
   some aspect of \textsl{Yoshimi} functionality.
   The major levels are:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Top Level}
      \item \textbf{System Effects}
      \item \textbf{Insertion Effects}
      \item \textbf{Part}
      \item \textbf{Part Effects}
      \item \textbf{Bank}
      \item \textbf{Scales (microtonal)}
      \item \textbf{Vector}
      \item \textbf{Config}
      \item \textbf{Synth Engines}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item \textbf{Addsynth}
         \item \textbf{Addsynth Voice}
         \item \textbf{Subsynth}
         \item \textbf{Padsynth Harmonics}
         \item \textbf{Padsynth Envelopes}
      \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

   Any level that has direct numerical content can be changed with "set (n)"
   once at that level.  The level is indicated by the text in the
   \textsl{Yoshimi} prompt.
   For example, one can set 1 to 16 vector channels, so, from the
   \textsl{Top} level, the following command will set the default (1, or the
   last-used number). The second command will, given this level (the
   \textsl{Vector} level), switch to vector channel 5. However, at the start,
   one could have gone straight to 5 with the third command.

   \begin{verbatim}
      set vector                          # or "s ve"; sets the context
      set 5                               # or "s 5"
      set vector 5                        # or "s ve 5"; quicker!
   \end{verbatim}

   A detailed discussion of command-line vector control is presented in
   \sectionref{subsection:vector_command_line}.

\subsection{Command Scripts}
\label{subsec:command_line_command_scripts}

   \textsl{Yoshimi} command-line users can run plain-text scripts that behave
   in exactly the same way as if the commands had been entered from the
   command-line directly.
   The actual script command can be initiated from any context/level and is
   simply:

   \begin{verbatim}
      RUN {filepath-of-script}
   \end{verbatim}

   To avoid confusion, the script routine first sets the context to the top
   level, then performs all the commands, following context level changes. If
   there is a fault in the script, it will be reported along with the number
   of the line where the error occurred. Due to the buffering used, the
   script will return before many of the actions have actually taken place.
   Therefore an error report is likely to be some way up the responses.
   Typically it will be something like:

   \begin{verbatim}
    *** Error: Which Operation? @ line 13 ***
   \end{verbatim}

   Here is a simple example:

   \begin{verbatim}
      # A script test
      set part on
          # These two lines are spaced in a bit
          set add on
      set voice on
      set volume 45
   \end{verbatim}

   This script makes sure the part is on, that the relative addsynth and
   voice are on, and finally sets its volume to 45.

   Although this process starts from the top level, it will use the
   parameters that were last set. Thus, if one had been working on part 7,
   addsynth voice 2, then that is the one that will have its volume adjusted.
   This means one can set up generic preferences, then apply them to any
   part, engine, etc.

   The script routine honours any normal abbreviations. Blank lines are
   ignored. A '\#' at the start of a line marks it as a comment so will also
   be ignored. However, both of these kinds of lines will be in the line
   count if an error is reported.

   Buffering can also cause commands to go out of sequence if a buffered one
   is immediately followed by a related direct one. For this reason there is
   an extra command specific to scripts:

   \begin{verbatim}
      WAIT [n]
   \end{verbatim}

   The command must be entered in full, and the range is 1 to 30,000
   milliseconds.
   In the example below, switching the kit mode is buffered but setting a kit
   item isn't, so without a delay the setting would be attempted before it
   was available. A 20ms wait seems to be enough of a delay in this case.
   \begin{verbatim}
      # Using delays
      s p 1 on
      s add off
      ..
      s mul
      wait 20
      s 5
      s on
      s sub on
   \end{verbatim}

   Since \textsl{Yoshimi} V 2.0.2 there has been an alternative command:
   \begin{verbatim}
      RUNLocal {filepath-of-script}
   \end{verbatim}
   As it's name suggests, this will run from the current context level.

\subsection{Other Command Tables}
\label{subsec:command_line_other_command_tables}

   When running from the command line, commands can be entered after the
   'up and running' message. Commands are \textsl{not} case-sensitive.

   \noindent With all of the following commands \newline
   Optional parameters are shown as: [ n ] for numbers or [ s ] for text
   strings \newline
   Compulsory parameters are shown as: \begin{math} \langle \end{math} n
   \begin{math} \rangle \end{math} for numbers or \begin{math} \langle
   \end{math} s \begin{math} \rangle \end{math} for text
   strings.

   \noindent Commands can be abbreviated to the first three letters of each
   command, or, in some cases, just one letter.  This is indicated by
   uppercase letters in command descriptions. The commands available depend
   on the current "context" of the command line. However, there is a group of
   commands always available:

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{p{3cm} p{12cm}}
\caption[Yoshimi Universial Commands]{Yoshimi Universal Commands} \\
\texttt{? Help} &
   show commands \\
\texttt{List} &
   list current settings \\
\texttt{GUide} &
   show location of most recent HTML guides \\
\texttt{STop} &
   all sound off \\
\texttt{RESet [s]} &
   return to startup conditions, 'ALL' clear MIDI-learn (if 'y') \\
\texttt{EXit [s]} &
   tidy up and close Yoshimi (if 'y'), 'FOrce' instant exit regardless \\
\texttt{RUN <s>} &
   execute named command script forcing top level start \\
\texttt{RUNLocal <s>} &
   execute named command from current context level \\
\texttt{  WAIT <n>} &
   1ms to 30,000mS delay - within script only \\
\texttt{..} &
   step back one context level \\
\texttt{/} &
   step back to top level \\
\end{longtable}
\end{center}

   Apart from these commands, the command line works on a system of context
   levels, and normally only the commands relevant to that "level"
   will be available.

   We describe the command lists here. These lists are relative to a
   particular context, and what one sees if one enters \textbf{?} while at
   that level, to get help. However the command lists can all be called
   \textsl{specifically} from any level and the normal abbreviations are
   accepted. For example, to list just the part commands regardless of what
   context it is called from:
   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi> ? p
   \end{verbatim}

   \noindent The most significant help lists only require the initial letter
   to be identified. For all the others one needs to enter the first three
   letters. Also, from any other level, \textbf{? ?} will show the top level
   ones.

\subsubsection{Top Commands}
\label{subsec:command_line_top_command_list}

   These commands are part of the Top context/command level. First, one gets
   the universal options, always available. Then there are several options
   that have an ellipsis (...); these are the context submenus. After that
   come all the actual top level controls; there are still a lot!
   Indenting is used to show command grouping.

   \begin{verbatim}

    stereo on the fly while \textsl{Yoshimi} is actually playing. This helps
    one make sure there is a good balance between these two.

\paragraph{SOlo}
\label{paragraph:command_line_solo}
   The \textbf{SOlo [s]} and \textbf{SOlo CC [n]}
   commands enable and set \textsl{Yoshimi}'s 'Solo' feature, whereby one can
   silently switch MIDI input to different parts.
   The 'Row', 'Loop' and 'TwoWay' types use the first 16 parts, while the
   'Column' type works \textsl{vertically} across the parts e.g. 1, 17, 33
   and 49. Finally Channel mode can use all possible 64 parts.

   The type setting has to be decided before setting 'CC', which then
   determines which MIDI controller to listen to for performing the actual
   switch. See \sectionref{subsec:mixer_panel_window}~which goes into more
   details about this setting, at a graphical user interface level.

\paragraph{Set / Read / MLearn Context Levels}
\label{paragraph:command_line_context_levels}

   The Set / Read commands set or read all main parameters and the MLearn one
   initiates a MIDI learn with exactly the same parameters.
   In fact there are three more commands that follow this pattern:

   \begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{MINimum}. Show the minimum value a command may set.
   \item \texttt{MAXimum}. Show the maximum value a command may set.
   \item \texttt{DEFault}. Show the default value of a command.
   \end{itemize}

   There are a few commands that set the context or command level, where
   additional commands peculiar to the "context" are provided.  Here are the
   command/context levels
   (also see \sectionref{subsec:command_line_command_level}.)
   Note that we also list commands for the effects levels.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{Part}. Enter context level for part operations.
      \item \texttt{VEctor}. Enter context level for vector operations.
      \item \texttt{SCale}. Enter context level for scale (microtonal)
      operations.
      \item \texttt{MLearn}. Enter context level for MIDI Learn line editing.
      \item \texttt{COnfig}. Enter context level for configuration settings.
      \item \texttt{SYStem effects [n]}. Enter the effects context level.
      \begin{itemize}
         \item \texttt{[s]}.  Set the effect type directly by name.
         \item \texttt{PREset [n]}. Set the numbered effect preset to n.
         \item \texttt{SEnd [n1] [n2]}. Send the current system effect to
         effect n1 at volume n2.
      \end{itemize}
      \item \texttt{INSert effects [n]}. Enter effects context level.
      \begin{itemize}
         \item \texttt{[s]}. Set the effect type directly by name.
         \item \texttt{PREset [n]}. Set numbered effect preset to n.
         \item \texttt{SEnd [s]/[n]}. Set where to send the effect
            ('Master', 'Off', or a part number).
      \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

\paragraph{Part Command Level}
\label{paragraph:command_line_context_level_part}

   This command switches to the part context level and makes all its commands
   accessible.  If no number '[n]' is entered it will be on the default part
   (1) or whatever was the previous part in use.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} has a number of commands for controlling and configuring
   the synth engines from the command-line. First of all there is the part
   kit structure. There are three modes (i.e. settings) that the kits of the
   engines can take:
\pagebreak
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item MUlti
      \item SIngle
      \item CRossfade
   \end{enumerate}

   These forms are exactly the same as the graphical controls, and can be set
   once in the part context. Starting at the part level prompt, this command
   will return the setting on the line after the command, and show a new
   context level prompt:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi Part 1+> set multi
      Part 1 Kit Mode multi
      yoshimi p1+, Multi 1+>
   \end{verbatim}

   This setting is at the kit item 1 (which is always enabled).
   Let's change to kit item 4, and, since it hasn't yet been enabled,
   Let's enable it and turn on the SubSynth engine so that it will sound:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi p1+, Multi 1+> set 4
      yoshimi p1+, Multi 4> set on
      yoshimi p1+, Multi 4+> set sub on
      yoshimi p1+, M4+ Sub+>
   \end{verbatim}

   Note how the prompt line is more compact, and indicates via the plus-signs
   that the part, kit, and subsynth are all on.

   These new controls are shown in the part context help list.
   The synth engines, AddSynth, Voice, SubSynth and PadSynth also have their
   own contexts with appropriate help lists.
   Also, LFO, Filter, Envelope and Resonance have their own contexts above
   whichever engine they are sitting on, so again have their own help lists.
   A fairly deep context is:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi P1+, M4+, A+, Voice 5+> set lfo frequency on
   \end{verbatim}

   From the voice context, this command would set the context shown below.

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi P1+, M4+, A+, V5+, LFO freq+>
   \end{verbatim}

   The need for compression is obvious, and once at this level, the
   \texttt{?} command will list the LFO controls.

   Kit mode is an unusual form of context level as it either modifies some
   part level controls or adds new ones. At the same time it still allows all
   the other part controls. The examples below show how kit mode interacts
   with part, and how one is informed of the exact status.

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi Part 1+> set multi
      yoshimi Part 1+, Multi 1+> set 2
      yoshimi Part 1+, Multi 2+> ..
      yoshimi Part 1+, (Multi)> set 3
      yoshimi Part 3> set 1
      yoshimi Part 1+, (Multi) set kit
      yoshimi Part 1+, Multi 1+>
   \end{verbatim}

   Note how the kit mode is shown in parenthesis when not actually in the kit
   editing context. Also, to disable kit mode the specific \textbf{NOR}mal
   command must be used, as the \textbf{ON/OFF} commands refer to individual
   kit items.

   It is also possible to emulate the action of some incoming MIDI CCs. This
   was initially needed so that they can be MIDI-learned, but also provides
   a means of checking and modifying these settings directly.

\subsection{MLearn}
\label{subsec:command_line_mlearn}
   There are actually two entry points for MLearn. The first takes the same
   form as set/read and initiates the MIDI learning process for a given
   control. The second is within 'set' and is for editing current lines.

   \textsl{min. entry to list commands for} MLearn: '? m'

   To enter the context for the second form start out with:
   \begin{verbatim}
      set mlearn
   \end{verbatim}
   and to find out what lines have been set:
   \begin{verbatim}
      list mlearn
   \end{verbatim}
   This will show all the current learned lines with their list numbers.
   In the same way as for the other numbered contexts, one can set the number
   of the line directly to edit it.

   The available commands are:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{MUte [s]}, Set to ON disables or, for any other provided
      token restores this line.
      \item \texttt{SEven} will interpret a learned NRPN as a 7-bit value.
      \item \texttt{CC [n]} will set the incoming controller value that will
         be recognised.  This command might re-order the list.
      \item \texttt{CHan [n]} will set the incoming channel number that will
         be recognised.  This command might re-order the list.
      \item \texttt{MIn [n]} will set the conversion for the incoming
         value to a minimum percentage.
      \item \texttt{MAx [n]} will set the conversion for the incoming
         value to a maximum percentage.
      \item \texttt{LImit [s]} set to Enable will use limiting instead of
         compression.  The conversion uses the minimum and maximum limits.
      \item \texttt{BLock [s]} set to ON, prevents this CC/channel pair from
        being passed on to any other lines or system controls.  It has no
        effect if the line has been muted.
   \end{itemize}

\subsection{EFfects Commands}
\label{subsec:command_line_effects}
   Since V 1.5.10 all effects controls have been exposed. However those
   available change dependent on the specific effect that is being managed.
   These controls are the same for System, Insertion and individual part
   effects. However, the exception is the 'Level' control that most of these
   have. This refers to the 'Dry/Wet' proportion of the effect apart from in
   System effects where it behaves as a volume control, without changing the
   'through' content.

   While part effects are 'immediate', in that one hears the results as soon
   as an effect type is selected, System effects need the part's
   \textbf{send} level to be increased, as it defaults to zero. Insertion
   effects however, need to have a \textbf{send} route selected as well as
   the effect type.

   There is some extra information given in V 1.5.11.
   When one chooses a new effect the first preset is always selected, which
   can then be edited to taste. Up to now, there was no indication that it
   had been altered apart from checking each control against its default. One
   could easily forget having edited this - especially if saving everything
   and coming back to it some days later.

\pagebreak
   In more recent \textsl{Yoshimi} versions there is a '?' on the end of the
   line if any of the controls on that preset are not the default values.
   So:
   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi> s sys 2 rev
      yoshimi Sys eff 2 REverb-1> s pre 4
      yoshimi Sys eff 2 REverb-4> s pan 36
   \end{verbatim}
   This has now changed the preset.
   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi Sys eff 2 REverb-4?> s pre 4
      yoshimi Sys eff 2 REverb-4>
   \end{verbatim}
   Notice how even re-selecting the same preset will return it to its default
   settings, and would be an easy mistake if there was no warning.

   Just leaving the effects to work on another part of \textsl{Yoshimi}, then
   returning to them won't change anything of course, and will again
   correctly show whether the current one has been altered.

\subsection{Bank Commands}
\label{subsec:command_line_bank_command_list}

   During the development of \textsl{Yoshimi} V 1.6 it was realised that
   the command line had little control of instrument bank management.
   This was expanded in V 1.6.1.

\textsl{min. entry to list commands for} Banks:  '? b'

   \begin{table}[H]
      \centering
      \caption{Yoshimi Bank Commands}
\label{table:yoshimi_text_bank_commands}
      \begin{tabular}{l l}

   \texttt{Bank} &
   Enters the Bank context. \\
   \texttt{[n]} &
   Sets the current bank to the one at slot n of the current bank root \\
   \texttt{  } &
   or reads the current bank's slot and name. \\
  \texttt{Name [s]} &
  Changes or reads just the name of the current bank. \\
  \texttt{Root [n]} &
  Sets the current bank root to n or reads the current full path. \\
  \texttt{Root ID [n]} &
  Changes the current bank root ID to n.  \\
  \texttt{INstrument Rename [n] [s]} &
  Changes the name of the instrument in slot n of the current bank.  \\
  \texttt{INstrument SAve [n]} &
  Saves the current part's instrument to bank slot n.  \\

        \end{tabular}
   \end{table}
\pagebreak
\subsection{Vector Commands}
\label{subsec:command_line_vector_command_list}
   A vector can be set on any standard MIDI channel, and allows a two or four
   part column to be managed as pairs for the given controls.
   The commands at this level deal with control of an X axis and a Y axis.
   The CC for the X axis must be set before everything else.  Then the CC for
   the Y axis must be set.  Finally, the other Y controls can be set.

   Note that for vectors, n by itself is the base channel.

   \textsl{min. entry to list commands for} Vector:  '? v'

   \begin{table}[H]
      \centering
      \caption{Yoshimi Vector Commands}
      \label{table:yoshimi_text_vector_commands}
      \begin{tabular}{l l}

\texttt{VEctor} &
   Enters the Vector context. \\
   \texttt{[n]} &
   Changes the channel number for setting/editing.\\
\texttt{[X/Y] CC [n]} &
   CC n is used for the X or Y axis sweep. \\
\texttt{[X/Y] Features [n] [s]} &
   Sets X or Y features n = 1 to 4 (s = "Enable", "Reverse", other = off).
   \\
\texttt{[X] PRogram [l/r] [n]} &
   Sets X program change ID n for left or right part. \\
\texttt{[Y] PRogram [d/u] [n]} &
   Sets Y program change ID n forL DOWN or UP part. \\
\texttt{[X/Y] Control [n1] [n2]} &
   Sets n2 CC to use for X or Y feature n1 = 2 to 4. \\
\texttt{Off} &
   Disables vector control for this channel.  Parts are unchanged. \\
\texttt{Name [s]} &
   Sets the internal name to s for this complete vector.  \\

      \end{tabular}
   \end{table}

   The \textbf{X/Y Features} command sets the features for the
   selected axis, and also if they are to be off or reversed.

   The \textbf{X/Y Control [n1] [n2]} command
   sets the n2 CC to use for the X or Y feature n1 = 2 to 4.
   This allows a change of the actual CC associated with features 2 through
   4. They can be any CC that \textsl{Yoshimi} recognises.

   Feature 1 is always fixed as Volume, and cannot be reversed. It is
   arranged such that it will try to maintian a constant overall volume from
   the paired instruments.

\subsection{Scales Commands}
\label{subsec:command_line_scales_command_list}

\textsl{min. entry to list commands for} Scales:  '? s'

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{p{4cm} p{10cm}}
\caption[Yoshimi Scales Commands]{Yoshimi Scales Commands} \\

\texttt{[ON/OFF]} & Enable/disable microtonal tuning. \\
\texttt{IMPort [s1] [s2]} &
   Import Scala file s2 to s1 TUNing or KEYmap.  \\
\texttt{EXPort [s1] [s2]} &
   Export s1 TUNing or KEYmap to Scala file s2. \\

\texttt{FRequency [n]} &
   Set the reference note's actual frequency to n, usually 69 (A4) to 440 Hz.
   \\
\texttt{NOte [n]} &
   Set the reference note's number to n. \\
\texttt{Invert [s]} &
   Invert the entire scale (ON / other) \\
\texttt{CEnter [n]} &
   Set the note number of the key's center to n. \\
\texttt{SHift [n]} &
   Shift the entire scale up or down by n. \\
\texttt{SCale [s]} &
   Activate microtonal scale (ON / other). \\
\texttt{MApping [s]} &
   Activate keyboard mapping (ON / other). \\

\texttt{MIddle [n]} &
   Set the middle note number to be mapped to n. \\
\texttt{Last [n]} &
   Set the last note number to be mapped to n. \\
\texttt{Tuning [s1]} &
   Set the CSV tuning values.
   Tuning sets the CSV tuning values, which are decimal numbers or ratios
   (n1.n1 or n1/n1, n2.n2 or n2/n2, etc.).\\
\texttt{Keymap [s]} &
   Set the CSV keymap (n1, n2, n3, etc.)
   Keymap sets the keyboard mapping values as a comma separated list. \\
\texttt{SIze [n]} &
   Sets the actual keymap size. \\
\texttt{NAme [s]} &
   Set the internal name for this scale. \\
\texttt{DEscription [s]} &
   Sets the description of this scale. \\
\texttt{CLEar} &
   Clear all settings and revert to the standard scale. \\
\end{longtable}
\end{center}

\subsection{Help List}
\label{subsec:command_line_help_list}

   One can now clearly see which items can be listed with:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi> list
   \end{verbatim}

   In general while \textbf{?} and \textbf{help} indicate what can be
   changed, \textbf{l} and \textbf{list} report the current status.

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{p{4cm} p{10cm}}
\caption[Yoshimi List Commands]{Yoshimi List Commands} \\

\texttt{Roots} &
   List all available root paths. \\
\texttt{Banks [n]} &
   List the banks in root ID [n] or the current root.
   This command shows all of the banks present in either the numbered ([n])
   bank root, or in the current one (if no number is provided).  \\
\texttt{Instruments [n]} &
   List instruments in bank ID [n] or current bank.
   This command shows all of the instruments present in either the numbered
   (n) bank root, or in the current one (if no number is provided).  \\
\texttt{Group [s1] [s2]} &
   List instruments types, s1 (name) list all of that type with list number,
   \\
\texttt{ } &
   s2 'Location' include root, bank, instrument numbers. \\
\texttt{Parts} &
   List parts with instruments installed. ('More' for extra details)\\
\texttt{Vectors} &
   List settings for all enabled vectors. \\
\texttt{Tuning} &
   Microtonal scale tunings. See the Scales section. \\
\texttt{Keymap} &
   Microtonal scale keyboard map.  See the Scales section. \\
\texttt{Config} &
   Show the current configuration. See the Config section. \\
\texttt{MLearn [s[n]]} &
   MIDI learned controls ('@ n' for full details on one line). \\
\texttt{SECtion} &
   Show saved copy/paste presets. \\
\texttt{History [s]} &
   Show recent files. See the extensive description below. \\
\texttt{Effects [s]} &
   List the effect types ([s] = 'all' includes preset numbers and names).
   If this command is called from the Effects level, then one sees only the
   name of the current effect and the number of presets. \\
\texttt{PREsets} &
   Show all the presets for the currently selected effect. \\

\end{longtable}
\end{center}

A few more detailed descriptions occur in the following sections, where there
is not enough room in the table above.

\subsubsection{List Group [s]}
\label{subsec:command_line_instrument_group_list}
   By itself, \textbf{List Group} or \textbf{L G} will show what instrument
   types are available. Repeating the command with one of these names will
   then search the entire bank structure listing the ones of that type, along
   with an index number. Assuming one is at part level, load this instrument
   into the current part with:
   \begin{verbatim}
      set instrument group (n)
   \end{verbatim}

   Unfortunately many instrument authors didn't identify a type, so the
   \textbf{undefined} list is the longest (although with revision
   of banks in V 2.0, this has reduced somewhat).

\subsection{List History [s]}
\label{subsec:command_line_list_history}

   Show the recent history of the following items [s]:
   Instruments, Patchsets, SCales, STates, Vectors, and MLearn).
   If no parameter is provided, show them all.

   The last-used file in any section is now always at the top of its history
   list, so it's easier to pick up where one left off. Instruments, patch
   sets, vectors, scales, MIDI-learn and state all offer the most recent
   entry whenever one wants to load or save.  On first-time use (when there
   is no history) the home directory will be offered as a location,
   regardless of where \textsl{Yoshimi} was called from.

   In the specific case of instruments, when \textsl{saving}, one is offered
   the instrument in the currently-selected part to the home directory,
   otherwise, when saving these 'managed' files, one won't be offered the
   previous last-used entry unless it was seen on that session, either by
   being loaded, or saved by name. This is to give some protection against
   accidental overwrites.

   For example:
   You have been working on the 'foo' instrument
   for a whole day, saving the whole patch set as you
   go. Then, the following day, you start up \textsl{Yoshimi}
   and immediately have a completely
   new idea 'bar' and start working on it. Without thinking, you save and hit
   Enter. Oops, you just wiped out 'foo'.
   Only now you haven't, because loading \textsl{Yoshimi}
   afresh would not have seen the older file, so now, saving
   will offer the home directory to put a new name in.

\subsubsection{List Load/Save}
\label{subsec:command_line_loadsave_list}

   And the same for load and save:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi> ? lo
      yoshimi> ? sa
   \end{verbatim}

   \begin{table}[H]
      \centering
      \caption{Yoshimi Load Commands}
      \label{table:yoshimi_text_load_commands}
      \begin{tabular}{l l}

\texttt{Instrument [s]} &
   Load instrument to current part from a named file [s]. \\
\texttt{SCale [s]} &
   Load and activate scale settings from named file [s]. \\
\texttt{VEctor [n] [s]} &
   Load and activate vector to channel n (or saved) from named file [s]. \\
\texttt{Patchset [s]} &
   Load and activate a complete patch set from named file [s]. \\
\texttt{MLearn [s]} &
   Load the full MIDI learned list from named file [s]. \\
\texttt{STate [s]} &
   Load all system settings and patch sets from named file [s]. \\

      \end{tabular}
   \end{table}

   For the \textbf{Load Instrument} command, the instrument is enabled if it
   is configured to be enabled.  For the \textbf{Load Vector} command, if
   there is no number parameter, the vector is loaded to the channel it was
   originally saved from.
   For the \textbf{Load Patchset} command, all instruments, scales, and
   vectors are loaded from the named file.
   For the \textbf{Load STate} command, all configuration, system settings,
   patch sets, and MIDI-learned lines are loaded from the named file.
   These notes also apply to the \textbf{Save} version of these commands.

   \begin{table}[H]
      \centering
      \caption{Yoshimi Save Commands}
      \label{table:yoshimi_text_loadsave_commands}
      \begin{tabular}{l l}

\texttt{Instrument [s]} &
   Save current part to named file [s]. \\
\texttt{SCale [s]} &
   Save current scale settings to named file [s]. \\
\texttt{VEctor [n] [s]} &
   Save vector on channel n to named file [s]. \\
\texttt{Patchset [s]} &
   Save complete set of instruments to named file [s]. \\
\texttt{MLearn [s]} &
   Save midi learned list to named file [s]. \\
\texttt{STate [s]} &
   Save all system settings etc. to named file [s].  See above. \\
\texttt{Config} &
   Save current configuration. \\

      \end{tabular}
   \end{table}

\subsubsection{Config Commands}
\label{subsec:command_line_config_list}

   Finally there is the (quite big) COnfig command level:

   \begin{verbatim}
      yoshimi> ? con
   \end{verbatim}

   Note that more complete descriptions follow this table.

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{p{4cm} p{10cm}}
\caption[Yoshimi Config Commands]{Yoshimi Config Commands} \\

\texttt{Oscillator [n]} &
   * Add/Pad size (power 2 256-16384).
   This sets the size of the buffer used for both AddSynth and PadSynth
   oscillators, and is always a power of 2.  \\
\texttt{BUffer [n]} &
   * Internal size (power 2 16-4096).
   This is the size of the audio buffer that \textsl{Yoshimi} uses.  For ALSA
   audio, it will always be the same size as ALSA's buffering, but for JACK
   it can be the same, bigger, or smaller. It is always a power of 2. \\
\texttt{PAdsynth [s]} &
   Interpolation type (Linear, other = cubic).
   Sets the quality of the interpolation that PadSynth uses on its
   wavetables.
   'Linear' is faster, but 'Cubic' is (potentially) very slightly better
   quality. \\
\texttt{BUIldpad [s]} &
   PADSynth wavetable build mode (Muted, Background, Autoapply)\\
\texttt{Virtual [n]} &
   Keyboard layout (0 = QWERTY, 1 = Dvorak, 2 = QWERTZ, 3 = AZERTY).
   This setting controls the layout of the virtual keyboard, and can match
   the commonest computer keyboards. \\
\texttt{Xml [n]} &
   Set the XML compression level to [n] (0-9).
   This is the amount of compression used on all
   \textsl{Yoshimi}'s data files. 9 is the most-compressed setting.
   0 is no compression, so that the configuration file
   can be read in an ordinary text editor. \\
\texttt{REports [s]} &
   Destination for reporting (Stdout, other = console).
   Determines where almost all information and error messages will be sent.
   A few will always go to \texttt{stderr} (such as the ones reporting a GUI
   problem). \\
\texttt{SAved [s]} &
   Saved instrument type. (Legacy - .xiz, Yoshimi - .xiy, Both).\\
\texttt{ENGine [s]} &
   Enable instrument engines and types info (OFF, {other})
   Slower initial start, but bank instruments can be selected by type and
   engines will be identified in lists.\\
\texttt{EXPose [s]} &
   Show current context level (ON, OFF, PRompt).\\
\texttt{STate [s]} &
   * Autoload default at start (Enable; other = disable).
   Sets whether a pre-saved default state file will be loaded on start-up. \\
\texttt{SIngle [s]} &
   * Force 2nd startup to open new instance instead (ON / other)\\
\texttt{Hide [s]} &
   Hide non-fatal errors (Enable; other = disable).
   Sets to ignore non-fatal system errors, or verbose messages. \\
\texttt{Display [s]} &
   GUI splash screen (Enable; other = disable).
   Enables \textsl{Yoshimi}'s start-up splash screen (which is
   enabled at first time start). \\
\texttt{Time [s]} &
   Add to instrument load message (Enable; other = disable).
   Attaches the time an instrument took to load and initialise to the loading
   message. \\
\texttt{Include [s]} &
   Include XML headers on file load (Enable; other = disable). \\
\texttt{Keep [s]} &
   Include inactive data on all file saves (Enable; other = disable).
   Sets up to include all data on file saves, including data for
   inactive and random elements. \\
\texttt{Gui [s]} &
   * Run with GUI (Enable, Disable).
   Run with the command-line interface enabled or disabled.  \\
\texttt{Cli [s]} &
   * run with CLI (Enable, Disable).
   Run with the command-line interface enabled. \\
\texttt{LOCk [s1][s2]} &
   Lock history of group s1 (ON, OFF).
   Groups - INstrument, PAtchset, SCale, STate, VEctor, MLearn. \\
\texttt{MIdi [s]} &
   * connection type (Jack, Alsa).
   Sets whether MIDI input comes from JACK or from ALSA.
   If not specified, JACK is the default, if it is present.  Otherwise,
   \textsl{Yoshimi} falls back to ALSA. \\
\texttt{AUdio [s]} &
   * connection type (Jack, Alsa).
   Sets whether audio is passed out to JACK or ALSA.  Again, JACK is the
   default, and ALSA is the fall-back.  \\
\texttt{ALsa Type [s]} &
   * midi connection type (Fixed, Search, External)
   Sets whether to use the list below, search for sources, or none at all. \\

\subsection{Command Descriptions}
\label{subsec:command_line_command_descriptions}

   This section describes the command-line commands in more detail.
   Obviously, some more needs to be written about some of the commands.
   Note that all the parameters for the \texttt{load} and \texttt{save}
   parameters are strings, and the parameters are compulsory, not optional.

   \setcounter{ItemCounter}{0}      % Reset the ItemCounter for this list.

   \itempar{".."}{cmd!up one level}
      \index{cmd!..}
      Step back up one command context level.
      This command can immediately precede another command, so that the
      second command takes places at the context above the current context.
      Note that it is like the OS's "cd .." command to change to the parent
      directory.

   \itempar{/}{cmd!to top level}
      \index{cmd!/}
      Step back up to the top command context level.
      This command can immediately precede another command, so that the
      second command takes places at the top context.
      Note that it is like the OS's "cd /" command to change to the root
      directory.

   \itempar{add bank [s]}{cmd!add bank}
      Define a new bank, \textsl{s}, where \textsl{s} is a bank name,
      and add it to the current root.

   \itempar{remove bank [s]}{cmd!remove bank}
      Delete the bank named \textsl{s}, and all its contents,
      from the current root path.

   \itempar{export bank [s [n1]] [n2] [s]}{cmd!export bank}
      The command line now has two commands to provide access to the new bank
      export and import controls. These are top level controls and are used
      as below.  The command above is used to export a bank. The square
      bracket term is optional, and enables one to select a different root to
      export from and would be in the form:

\begin{verbatim}
   EXport Root (root ID number) (bank ID number)
   (full path name to export to)
\end{verbatim}

   If one is happy to export from the currently selected root, then this
   simplifies to:

\begin{verbatim}
   EXport (bank ID number) (full path name to export to)
\end{verbatim}

   \itempar{import bank [s [n1]] [n2] [s]}{cmd!import bank}
      Import of a bank uses the identical syntax of the export command.
      A full example using the normal abbreviations is:

\begin{verbatim}
   im r 5 25 /home/will/downloads/some new bank
\end{verbatim}

      This will look for the directory "some new bank" (spaces are accepted)
      in the download directory of user "will". It will then copy it into
      bank number 25 of root number 5. It first checks to ensure that the new
      named bank exists, root 5 exists, and bank 25 is empty.

   \itempar{add root [s]}{cmd!add root}
      Define a new root path, \textsl{s}, and add it to the list of root
      paths.

   \itempar{remove root [s]}{cmd!remove root}
      De-list the root path named \textsl{s}, but doesn't alter the contents.

   \itempar{list banks [n]}{cmd!list banks}
      List the instruments and IDs in bank \textsl{n} or the
      current bank/root.

   \itempar{list effects [s]}{cmd!list effects}
      List effect types for \textsl{s}.
      If the parameter is the word \textsl{all},
      then list every effect and all its
      presets along with the preset number.

   \itempar{list history [s]}{cmd!list history}
      Displays the recently-used files, including patchsets, scales, and
      states.  If no parameter is given, then this command lists all three
      files in sequence.  The shortest version of this command is
      \texttt{l h p} (for patchsets, which returns the last-seen patchset
      list).

      \index{at-sign}
      \index{cmd!at-sign}
      \index{cmd!list operator}
      Once that list is displayed,
      the \texttt{@} operator can be used to access
      the item by number.  For example, to load the patch set at location 4
      in the list:

      \begin{verbatim}
         yoshimi> lo p @4
      \end{verbatim}

   \itempar{list instruments [n]}{cmd!list instruments}
      List all instruments and IDs in bank \textsl{n}
      or the current bank/root.
      Listing instruments will identify the current one with an asterisk, and
      shows the current bank and root one is listing from, and adds a suffix
      to the entry with \textbf{A}, \textbf{S}, or \textbf{P} depending on
      the combination of AddSynth, SubSynth, and PadSynth.

   \itempar{list parts}{cmd!list parts}
      Lists the number of parts available and parts with instruments
      currently installed along with any enabled with the default sound.
      Also shows their audio destination:
      \textsl{M} = main L/R, \textsl{P} = part L/R, \textsl{B} = both, and
      \textsl{-} = disabled or unavailable.
      This way one can tell if an instrument patch is installed even if it is
      not currently usable.
      To avoid unnecessary list length, the default "Simple Sound" is not
      shown unless it is enabled.

   \itempar{list roots}{cmd!list roots}
      Displays all defined root paths.
      Listing roots will identify the current ones with an asterisk.

   \itempar{list setup}{cmd!list setup}
      Displays the current dynamic system settings.

   \itempar{list vector [n]}{cmd!list vector}
      Lists the settings for vector on channel \textsl{n}.

   \itempar{load instrument [s]}{cmd!load instrument}
      Loads an instrument into the current part from the named file.
%     The file-name parameter \textsl{s} is mandatory.

   \itempar{load patchset [s]}{cmd!load instrument}
      Load a complete patch set from a named file, \textsl{s}.
      A variation on this command is \texttt{load patchset @4}, which
      loads the patchset at location 4, the 4th item in the list.

   \itempar{load vector [s]}{cmd!load vector}
      Loads an vector setup from the named file.
      The file-name parameter \textsl{s} is mandatory.

   \itempar{save patchset [s]}{cmd!save patchset}
      Saves the current patchset to the file named \textsl{s}.

   \itempar{save instrument [s]}{cmd!save instrument}
      Saves the instrument of the current part to the named file.
      The file-name parameter \textsl{s} is mandatory.

   \itempar{save setup}{cmd!save setup}
      Save the current dynamic system settings.
      Most settings get saved to the state file for the current instance,
      but a few are saved in the master config file.

   \itempar{save vector [s]}{cmd!save vector}
      Saves the vector setup to the named file.
      The file-name parameter \textsl{s} is mandatory.

   \itempar{set activate [n]}{cmd!set activate}
      Set part-activate on MIDI program change.
      \textsl{n} = 0 disables this feature, and
      1 or any non-zero value enables this feature.
      This feature applies to command line program change as well.

   \itempar{set alsa audio [s]}{cmd!set alsa audio}
      Sets the name of the audio hardware device ALSA looks for.
      Requires a restart of \textsl{Yoshimi}.

   \itempar{set alsa midi [s]}{cmd!set alsa midi}
      Sets the name of the MIDI source ALSA looks for.
      Requires a restart of \textsl{Yoshimi}.

   \itempar{set available [n]}{cmd!set available}
      Set the number of available parts (16, 32, 64).
      Note that 32 and 64 are supported in the newest versions of
      \textsl{Yoshimi}.  Also note that a single two-part vector setup (the
      \textbf{X} vector) requires 32 parts, while the dual two-part vector
      setup (both \textbf{X} and \textbf{Y}) requires 64 parts.

   \itempar{set bank [n]}{cmd!set ccbank}
      Set the MIDI CC for bank changes ((Msb, Lsb, Off)).

   \itempar{set root [n]}{cmd!set ccroot}
      Set the MIDI CC for root path changes ((Msb, Lsb, Off)).

   \itempar{set extend [n]}{cmd!set extend}
      Set CC value for extended program change (values above 119 disables
      this feature).

   \itempar{set insert effect [n]}{cmd!set insert effects}
      Set insertion effect for editing. Where \textsl{n} is from 1 to 8.

   \itempar{set jack midi [s]}{cmd!set jack midi}
      Sets the name of the JACK MIDI source for \textsl{Yoshimi}.
      Requires a restart of \textsl{Yoshimi}.

   \itempar{set jack server [s]}{cmd!set jack server}
      Sets the name of the JACK server \textsl{Yoshimi} tries to connect to.
      Requires a restart of \textsl{Yoshimi}.

   \itempar{set part [n1] program [n2]}{cmd!set part program}
      Load instrument \textsl{n2} into part \textsl{n1}.
      Example: \texttt{set part 4 program 130}

   \itempar{set part [n1] channel [n2]}{cmd!set part channel}
      Set the MIDI channel \textsl{n2} for part \textsl{n1}.
      If the channel number is greater than 15, no further MIDI
      messages will be accepted by that part.

   \itempar{set part [n1] destination [n2]}{cmd!set part destination}
      Set the audio destination of part \textsl{n1}
      to main (\textsl{1}), part (\textsl{2}), both (\textsl{3}).
      Also enables the part if not already enabled.

   \itempar{set preferred audio [s]}{cmd!set preferred audio}
      Set the audio connection type.
      The parameter should be either "jack" or "alsa".

   \itempar{set preferred midi [s]}{cmd!set preferred midi}
      Set the MIDI connection type.
      The parameter should be either "jack" or "alsa".

   \itempar{set - preset [n]}{cmd!set effect preset}
      Set effect preset.
      Set numbered effect preset.

   \itempar{set program [n]}{cmd!set program}
      Set MIDI program change (0 disables, anything else enables).

   \itempar{set reports [n]}{cmd!set reports}
      Sets the report destination or where messages are displayed, and, to
      some extent, which messages are displayed.  Here are the variations on
      this command that are supported:

      \begin{itemize}
         \item \texttt{set reports gui} or \texttt{s r g}.
            All reports are sent to the GUI console window.
         \item \texttt{set reports stderr} or \texttt{s r s}.
            All reports are sent to stderr.
         \item \texttt{set reports show} or \texttt{s r sh}.
            All messages are displayed.
         \item \texttt{set reports hide} or \texttt{s r h}.
            Non fatal low-level messages are discarded.
         \item \texttt{set reports (any other word or nothing at all)} or
            \texttt{s r (other)}.
            This sets the default condition of sending reports to the CLI and
            displaying all of them.
      \end{itemize}

   \itempar{set root [n]}{cmd!set root}
      Set current root path to ID \textsl{n}.

   \itempar{set shift [n]}{cmd!set shift}
      Set the master key shift for following notes in semitones (+-
      octave, 64 for no shift).

   \itempar{set system effects [n]}{cmd!set system effects}
      Set System Effects for editing.

   \itempar{set vector [n1] x/y cc [n2]}{cmd!set vector cc}
      CC \textsl{n2} is used for channel \textsl{n1} X or Y axis sweep.
      For X, this also enables vector control for the channel.

      \index{vector!features}
      The individual features are now numbered 1-4 and can be
      \index{vector!enable} \texttt{enabled} or
      \index{vector!reverse} \texttt{reversed} (any
      other word disables the feature).
      "Reversed" means that, instead of the X left rising in
      value with increasing CC value, it decreases.
      X right does the opposite of course.

      Feature 1 is always fixed as 7 (volume) and is not reversible.
      Features 2 to 4 can also have the outgoing CC changed to any valid one.
      The vector is just about the only command-line
      entry that starts from 1.

      The original system where bits were ORred together was done to make
      NRPN control as efficient as possible. That hasn't changed, but log
      messages refer to the command-line numbering.

      A more detailed discussion of command-line vector control is presented
      in \sectionref{subsection:vector_command_line}.

   \itempar{set vector [n1] x/y features [n2]}{cmd!set vector features}
      Sets channel \textsl{n1} X or Y features to \textsl{n2}.

   \itempar{set vector [n1] x/y program [l/r] [n2]}{cmd!set vector program}
      Loads program \textsl{n2} to channel \textsl{n1} X or Y
      \textsl{left} or \textsl{right} part.

   \itempar{set vector [n1] x/y control [n2] [n3]}{cmd!set vector control}
      Sets \texttt{n3} CC to use for X or Y feature \texttt{n2} (2, 4, 8).
      \textsl{n3} is the CC to be used for feature number \textsl{n2} on X
      vector channel \textsl{n1}. The \textsl{x} is a sort of hidden
      parameter as the code uses an offset dependent on whether it is
      \textsl{x} or \textsl{y}. Also \textsl{n1} can be omitted in which case
      it will use the last defined channel number. Using alternate words and
      numbers gives a great deal of flexibility like this.

   \itempar{set vector [n] [off]}{cmd!set vector}
      Disables vector control for channel \textsl{n}.

   \itempar{set volume [n]}{cmd!set volume}
      Set the master volume.

   \itempar{reset}{cmd!reset}
      Return to the start-up conditions, if 'y' selected.

   \itempar{stop}{cmd!stop}
      Cease all sound immediately!

   \itempar{? or help}{cmd!help}
      List commands for current mode.  All of the minimum command-line
      abbreviations are capitalised in the help listing.

   \itempar{exit}{cmd!exit}
         Tidy up and close \textsl{Yoshimi} down.

\subsection{Direct Access}
\label{subsec:command_line_direct_access}

   \index{Direct Access}
   \index{cmd!direct access}
   \textsl{Direct Access} is a very low-level access method for most of the
   controls in \textsl{Yoshimi} control.
   It is a test feature accessible only from the command line.
   There are virtually no error checks on direct-access, so one can easily
   crash \textsl{Yoshimi} with out of range values.
   It mostly updates the GUI too.

   Since V 1.6.0 direct access has been disabled as it no longer produces
   valid data. Also, all available controls are now provided in a fully
   protected manner.

   For developers there is relevant information within the source code.
