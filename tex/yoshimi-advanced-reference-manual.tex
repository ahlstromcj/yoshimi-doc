\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

   This manual was inspired by a wiki version of a
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} manual (see reference \cite{zynwiki}).  That wiki
   shows screen shots and a
   detailed survey of the settings and parameters of \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}.  It
   inspired us to thoroughly document \textsl{Yoshimi}, with the help of
   Will Godfrey, who, with the 'little band of helpers' continues to improve
   \textsl{Yoshimi} at great pace.
   This manual owes much to the descriptions and diagrams provided by the
   original \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} author, Paul Nasca, as well as some others
   whose names we don't know.

\subsection{Yoshimi And ZynAddSubFX}
\label{subsec:introduction_yoshimi_vs_zyn}

   \textsl{Yoshimi} is an algorithmic MIDI software synthesizer for Linux.
   It synthesizes in real time, can run polyphonic or monophonic, with multiple
   simultaneous patches on one or more MIDI channels, and has broad microtonal
   capability. It includes extensive addititive, subtractive,
   and pad synth capabilities which can be run simultaneously within the
   same patch.  It also has eight audio effects modules.

   This manual describes how to use \textsl{Yoshimi} \cite{yoshimi},
   the software synthesizer derived from the great
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFx} (version 2.4.0) \cite{zynaddsubfx} software
   synthesizer (Copyright 2002-2009 Nasca Octavian Paul).
   This manual uses some earlier \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} documentation and
   diagrams.  Please note that any reference to \textsl{ZynAddSubFx}
   in this manual applies specifically to versions of \textsl{ZynAddSubFx}
   prior to version 3.0.

\iffalse
   continued for quite a while in its own direction. These include
   major optimizations for audio and MIDI performance,
   progressive development of user-level and command-line access to all
   controls, MIDI learn, and vector control.
   At the same time, refinement continues, both visually and within the code.

   What are the advantages of
   \textsl{Yoshimi} versus \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}?
   At one time \textsl{Yoshimi} had better JACK support
   than \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}, but that is no longer true.
   Both projects are in active development, and both are
   progressing along their respective roadmaps.
   \textsl{Yoshimi} currently has a considerably
   revised graphical user-interface,
   while \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} has a major user-interface upgrade planned.
   Each project has some features and capabilities that the other lacks.
   There may be internal differences of importance to
   a developer, as well as features that aren't so easy to discover.  So,
   really, ... use them both!

   -- the \textsl{ZynAddSubFx} project is planning
   a major user-interface change for version 3.0, and many of the file formats
   will change as well.  Of course, one can still continue to use the old
   "Zyn" as well.
\fi

\subsection{New Features}
\label{subsec:introduction_new_features}

   This section provides an \textsl{ad hoc}, catch-as-catch-can survey of the
   new features of \textsl{Yoshimi}, in no particular order.
   There are new features for the command-line interface, and many internal
   fixes to reduce the likelihood of "xruns", static, clicks, or other
   performance issues.

\subsubsection{New for Version 2.3.1}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_2_3_1}
There has been some revision of microtonal scales. The most noticable is that you can now export both tunings and keymaps. A little less obvious is the Map Size in now editable.

\subsubsection{New for Version 2.3.0}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_2_3_0}
The most obvious development with this release is the ability to create and select different colour themes covering the whole of the graphic interface. These can be applied immediately on a running \textsl{Yoshimi} instance. At the same time \textsl{action} and \textsl{link} buttons have been changed to make them more obviously different. On advice received, identification uses both colour and button shape.

It was noticed that some users were not aware that many buttons were MIDI-learnable, so the way these are represented has also been changed. All sliders are learnable as are all rotary 'knobs' (as before). Now, all check boxes, buttons, menus, spin boxes and number rollers that have blue bold italic labels are learnable. This is much more obvious than previously.

Additionally, sliders and knobs now identify when they are at their default setting. With knobs, the pointer is black, and red when at any other position. With sliders the 'peg' has a green centre which again becomes red when changed.

Under the hood is a less obvious but highly significant improvement. A range of controls that were saved as stepped 0 to 127 values are now saved as high resolution values. However this is done in a way that is completely both forward and backward compatible. Old files can be accurately read, and new files can be read by older \textsl{Yoshimi} verisons at their native resolution.

\subsubsection{New for Version 2.2.0}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_2_2_0}
   A major development here concerns the PadSynth engine. It is now
   possible to make changes deep within this structure without interruption
   while notes are sounding. There is a setting to enable the sound to
   smoothly fade from one setting to the next over a few milliseconds.
   Alternatively one can set a new control in the PadSynth engine itself to
   spread the change over several seconds for a unique musical effect.

   Another much requested feature is a comprehensive Undo/Redo capability.
   This is most useful when wanting to try changing something but with the
   safety net of being able to revert if the result is unsatisfactory.

   When we first implemented BPM sync for LFOs etc. we had to provide a
   fallback in case there was no incoming MIDI clock to sync to. We set
   this to the standard 120 BPM. Now, however there is a control so that it
   can be set over a wide range to get exactly the wanted effect.

\subsubsection{New for Version 2.1.1, 2.1.2}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_2_1_1}

   The most noticeable feature is a new button in the main window for access to
   the MIDI CCs window. This was always accessible, but required a right-click on
   the Controllers button; many people never knew it was available!
   These controls can be used with no MIDI source connected, and they can be
   learned and combined with others for greater expression.

   Improved instrument bank management gives a faster startup (particularly
   with very large banks and roots) and greater protection against outside
   influences. A setup with 7500 instruments in 200 banks used to take nearly 5
   seconds to get to the main window, and now takes much less than a second.

   There is a new ability to separate properly instruments in banks with the
   same numeric prefix, but different names. Also, two that have different
   file-names but the same prefix (and are in fact the same) are treated as
   just the one. This situation typically occurs when banks were merged in the
   past with a mixture of spaces and underscores in the filenames.

   We've removed the switch for disabling 'Enable part on program change'. It
   was only relevant to MIDI and nobody could think of a circumstance where one
   would want to select a program via MIDI but not have it active. If one wants
   to silence a channel, CC7 (volume) would do so, and if it was just a
   specific part, there is an NRPN that can do it.

   A double-click on a path in the filer favourites view will now select it and
   return you to the main filer window.

\subsubsection{Resizeable Windows}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_resizable_windows}
   A major development with version 2.0 of \textsl{Yoshimi} is the ability to
   resize every window right up to the size of the monitor - even on 4K screens.
   Full details can be found in \sectionref{sec:revised_interface}

\subsubsection{Instant Control}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_instant_control}
   As of version 1.7.0, \textsl{Yoshimi} is able to give immediate response to
   almost all rotary controls and sliders. This is also true of many of the
   switches as well. Previously only a very small number responded straight away,
   while most only responded on the next note played.

\subsubsection{MIDI Learn}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_midi_learn}

   \textsl{Yoshimi}, as of version 1.5.0, supports MIDI Learn.
   It is available by right-clicking on the desired parameter widget.
   See \sectionref{subsubsec:concepts_midi_learn},
   and \sectionref{sec:midi_learn}, for more information.

\subsubsection{LV2 Plugin}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_lv2_plugin}

   \textsl{Yoshimi} can run as an LV2 plugin.  Supported features:

   \begin{enumber}
      \item Sample-accurate MIDI timing.
      \item State save/restore support via \textsl{LV2\_State\_Interface}.
      \item Working UI support via \textsl{LV2\_External\_UI\_Widget}.
      \item Programs interface support via \textsl{LV2\_Programs\_Interface}.
      \item Multi-channel audio output.
         'outl' and 'outr' have lv2 index 2 and 3.
         All individual ports numbers start at 4.
   \end{enumber}

   See \sectionref{sec:lv2_plugin}, for more information, but keep in
   mind there is still much more to document concerning the LV2 plugin.

\subsubsection{Control Automation}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_control_automation}

   Controls automation support is a part of a common
   controls interface.  There are significant extensions to the NRPNs that
   \textsl{Yoshimi} handles.
   Sensitivity to MIDI volume change (CC \#7) is variable in
   \textbf{Controllers} in the same way as pan width, etc. The numeric range is
   64 to 127; the default at 96 gives the same sensitivity as before at -12dB
   relative to the GUI controls.  127 gives 0dB and 64 gives -26dB.

   In parallel with this there are more NRPNs supported so that one can perform
   some of these controls via automation. The arrangement looks positively
   steam-punk, but is actually very easy to use, requiring only a utility that
   can send MIDI CCs.  NRPNs aren't special. They are simply a specific pattern
   of CCs.  \textsl{Yoshimi}'s implementation is very forgiving, doesn't mind
   if one stops halfway through (will just get on with other things while it
   waits) and will report exactly what it is doing.
   See \sectionref{sec:nrpns}, for more information, as well as the sections
   noted below.

\subsubsection{MIDI CC}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_midi_cc}

   To help when things don't seem to go right, one can show raw incoming
   CCs. This is enabled from the \textbf{Settings / MIDI CCs} tab.
   These are the values before \textsl{Yoshimi} does any processing.

   MIDI program changes have always been pretty clean from the time Cal first
   introduced them, but now GUI changes are just as clean. While it is
   generally best to change a program when the part is silent, even if a part
   is sounding there is barely a click. There is no interference at all
   with any other sounding parts.

   Sometimes MIDI CCs don't seem to give the results one expects. There is
   a setting that reports all incoming CCs so that one can discover
   what \textsl{Yoshimi} actually sees (which may not be what was expected).

   \index{breath control}
   \index{MIDI CC!breath control}
   At the request of one user, \textsl{Yoshimi} has an implementation of CC 2,
   Breath Control. This feature combines volume with filter cutoff.
   See \sectionref{subsubsec:concepts_midi_messages}, for more information.

   \index{legato}
   \index{MIDI CC!legato}
   \textsl{Yoshimi} implements the "legato footswitch" control,
   MIDI CC 68.
   Send this command with a value of 64 and above, and it will
   switch to Legato mode. Send less than 64, and it will revert to whatever it
   was before.  So, if the mode had been Poly, it goes back to that, and it it
   already was Legato, it just stays at Legato.

\subsubsection{Vectors}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_vectors}

   It's probably best to more clearly separate the concept of
   \textsl{parts} versus \textsl{channels} these days.
   \textsl{Yoshimi} can provide up to 64 parts, in blocks of 16. One can
   decide how many one wants to have available using the spin-box alongside
   the channel number.  One can have 16, 32 or 64 parts.  By default, all the
   upper parts are mapped to the same MIDI channel numbers as the lowest ones,
   but have independent voice and patch set values. They cannot normally
   receive independent note or control messages. However, vector control will
   intelligently work with however many are set, as will all the NRPN direct
   part controls.
   See \sectionref{sec:vector}, for more information.

\subsubsection{Bank Support}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_bank_support}

   Bank root directories are better identified, with IDs that can be changed by
   the user in the GUI. This is also made available for selecting over MIDI.
   MIDI only sees banks in the \textsl{current}
   \textbf{root} directory, but all banks are accessible to the GUI.
   One can set up a new bank root path when starting from the
   command line. This takes the form:

   \begin{verbatim}
      $ yoshimi -D /home/(username)/(directory)/(subdirectory)/bank
   \end{verbatim}

   \textsl{Yoshimi} will scan this path for new banks, but
   won't make the root (or any of its banks) current. The final directory
   doesn't have to be \texttt{banks}, but that is tradition.
   When running from the command line there is access to many
   of the system and root, bank, and other settings.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} splits out roots and banks from the main configuration
   file, and creates a new "history" file. The separation means that the
   different functions can be implemented, saved, and loaded at the most
   appropriate time. These files have "yoshimi" as the doc-type.
   See the new Banks sections,
   \sectionref{sec:banks_and_roots}
   and
   \sectionref{subsec:banks_collection_yoshimi},
   for more information.

\subsubsection{Accessibility}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_accessibility}

   An important feature of recent releases of \textsl{Yoshimi} is improved
   accessibility. The effectiveness and usefulness of accessibility will
   shape future complementary interfaces. A number of first-time defaults
   have been changed to make accessibility easier.

   It has always been possible to run \textsl{Yoshimi} headless. Since V
   1.5.11 it has been possible to \textsl{compile} a headless version with
   no need for any graphical components to be installed. Real accessible
   control is available.

   Once running, all setup can be done within the terminal window.
   Some settings will require a restart.
   There is also extensive control of
   roots, banks, parts and instruments including the ability to list and set
   all of these. One can do things like:

   \begin{verbatim}
      add root /home/music/yoshimi/banks
      set part 4 program 130
   \end{verbatim}

   Additional controls that are taken for granted in the GUI but
   otherwise forgotten are master key shift and master volume.  The
   most important parts of vector control are exposed to the command line.
   For all of this there is extensive error checking and feedback, which can be
   rendered in voice using text-to-speech software.

   There is a partially-sighted person we hear from, and
   a totally blind person (working with a Braille reader/writer) who has
   offered a lot of suggestions, and very much likes vector control.  So
   accessibility \index{accessibility} is an important feature of
   \textsl{Yoshimi}.  See the section that follows.

\subsubsection{Command Line}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_command_line}

   \textsl{Yoshimi} offers great control of one's working environment.
   One can have the graphical user interface, a command-line
   interface, or both, and these settings can be saved.  And both
   interfaces can be disabled, so \textsl{Yoshimi} runs in a headless
   mode, responding in the background to MIDI events.

   The command-line interface can access all top level controls, as well as the
   part editing controls, and can select any effect and effect preset.  It can be
   used to set up Vector Control much more quickly and easily than using NRPNs.
   It allows settings to be made to the various synthesis engines.
   The command-line is also context-sensitive, which, with careful choice
   of command names and abbreviations, allows fast access with minimal
   typing.

   Since version 1.5.8 it has been possible to start, stop and select
   different instances for further control.

   \textsl{Yoshimi}'s parser is case-insensitive for commands (but not for
   filenames), and accepts the shortest unambiguous abbreviation. It is
   quite pedantic, and expects spelling to be correct regardless of length.
   Apart from the \texttt{back} commands, it is word-based, so spaces are
   significant.  Some examples:

   "\texttt{s p 4 pr 6}" ("set part 4 program 6"):
   This command sets part 4 to the instrument with ID 6 from the current bank.
   It also leaves one at the part context level and pointed to part 4.
   Additionally, the fact that it loaded an instrument means it will activate
   that part if it was off (and the configuration setting is checked). In most
   cases the words \textbf{program} and \textbf{instrument} are interchangeable.

   "\texttt{s ef 1 rev}" ("set effect 1 reverb"):
   This command moves one to the effects context level and sets that part's
   effect number 1 to effect type \textbf{reverb}.

   "\texttt{s pre 2}" ("set preset 2"):
   This command sets preset number 2 (we use numbers here as most preset names
   repeat the effect type).

   "\texttt{..s 6 v 80}" ("up one level, set part 6 volume 80"):
   This command drops one back to part level, switches one to part 6 (but doesn't
   enable it), and sets its volume to 80.

   "\texttt{/s ve cc 93}" ("to top level, set vector control cc 93"):
   This command drops up to the top level, and sets vector control for
   channel 1, X axis to respond to CC 93 leaving one in the vector context.

   Whenever intermediate values are omitted, the default or last-used value
   will be assumed.
   All \textsl{standard} CLI inputs, and the return message numbers,
   should start from 1 with the following exceptions:

    \begin{itemize}
       \item Bank roots
       \item Banks
       \item CCs
       \end{itemize}

   These follow standard MIDI practice in the CLI and in the GUI.

   The CLI prompt always
   shows what level one is on, and the help-lists are also
   context-sensitive, so one doesn't see a lot of irrelevant clutter.
   See \sectionref{sec:command_line}, for more information.

\subsubsection{Audio Support}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_audio_support}

   The preferred JACK/ALSA MIDI and audio interfaces are no longer fixed at
   compile time. There are checkboxes on \textbf{Settings} to change them.
   One can also set preferred startup ALSA/JACK MIDI and audio devices.
   These selections will be remembered on the next run.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} will always start even if the audio/MIDI backend called
   for doesn't exist. In this situation, it will try all combinations in this
   order: JACK, ALSA, and null. This enables one to then change the settings
   and try again.

   A significant improvement is the handling of ALSA audio, which is very
   important for some people.  \textsl{Yoshimi} can handle 2-channel 16-bit
   format. Tests have shown that virtually all motherboard sound chipsets will
   handle this setting, but many external ones don't.  So \textsl{Yoshimi}
   initially requests 32-bit 2-channel, then works towards a compromise with the
   hardware.
   See \sectionref{paragraph:menu_yoshimi_settings_alsa_tab}, for details.

\subsubsection{User Feedback}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_user_feedback}
   With any complex software it is important that the user is kept informed
   as to exactly what the current status is, and over time \textsl{Yoshimi}
   has had extensive development of tooltips, warnings and action reports.

   For example, since V 1.5.11 one is now warned if an effect is a modified
   version of a preset and not it's default. This is in the form of changing
   the background colour of the preset button to a bright blue.

   When editing an AddSynth voice that is taking its waveform from another one
   there is a new warning when actually entering the waveform window.

\subsubsection{Miscellany}
\label{subsubsec:new_features_miscellany}

   \textsl{Yoshimi} stamps its XML files
   with its own major
   and minor version numbers underneath the existing ones, so it is possible
   to tell which version created the files.
   If the files (such as config) are not compatible with
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFX},
   the doctype and all other details are identified as purely for
   \textsl{Yoshimi}.

   One can direct messages to either \texttt{stderr}
   (the error output of a terminal console) or the \textbf{Reports} window
   on the fly. If one chose \texttt{stderr}, the \textbf{Reports} window is
   inactive.

   One can use the mouse scroll wheel to adjust rotary controls. Holding
   down the Ctrl key gives access to finer adjustment.  Also, horizontal as
   well as vertical mouse movement will adjust the knob.

   All rotary controls and sliders will return
   to their home positions if right-clicked anywhere in the control.

   As of version 1.5.8 switches, buttons and
   selectors will also home with a right-click.

   Part-editing windows carry the part number and voice name in the title
   bar. For the AddSynth oscillator window this also includes the voice
   number.

   When opening an instrument bank, one can tell exactly which synth
   engines are used by each instrument. This is represented by three pale
   background colours: Red = AddSynth; Blue = SubSynth; and Green = PadSynth.

   If the instruments are kits they are scanned to find out if any member of the
   kit contains each engine, so that the colours above can be applied.
   This feature is duplicated in the current part, the mixer panel for the
   currently loaded instruments, and in the Instrument Edit window.
   The same colours highlight the engine names when they are enabled with the
   check boxes.

   \textsl{Yoshimi} remembers where windows were last placed (per instance),
   and they will be reopened at the same location on the next run.

   Thanks to the \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} developers, \textsl{Yoshimi} has pink
   as well as white noise available on AddSynth voices. Pink noise sounds
   softer.  In \textsl{Yoshimi} version 1.6.0 we added spot noise, which has
   a sort of 'gritty' sound.

   The \textbf{Humanise} feature has had more interest so it's been upgraded.
   It's now a pair of sliders, and its settings can be saved in patch sets.
   It provides a tiny per-note random detune and/or velocity attenuation to
   an \textsl{entire} part (all engines in all kits), but only for that part.

   Audio and MIDI preferences have been improved. If one sets ALSA MIDI
   and JACK audio from the GUI or the command line, the setting can be
   saved and will be reinstated on the next run. These settings are
   per-instance, so if one has multiple sound cards, one can make full use of
   them.  Barring major system failures, there are no circumstances where
   \textsl{Yoshimi} will fail to start.

   We've tested \textsl{Yoshimi} in recovery mode, logged in as root, with
   no X server.

   The command \texttt{/usr/share/bin/yoshimi -A -i} worked perfectly and
   auto-connected the keyboard. Since version 1.5.11 one can provide a
   compile-time option to build a purely headless version.

   Load and Save dialogues recognise the history lists and offer
   the appropriate first choice. External instrument loads and saves are
   also remembered.
   For saves, on a restart, one is offered the home directory regardless
   of where \textsl{Yoshimi} was launched, but in the case of saving
   external instruments, one is always offered the name of the instrument
   in the currently selected part, prefixed with the home directory.

   There is a specific \textsl{State} menu item ("Save as Default") to save
   the current complete setup as the default. This particular state file is
   always saved to \textsl{Yoshimi}'s configuration directory, and will not
   show in history lists.

   If \textbf{Start With Default State} has been set, and a
   default state has been saved, a complete restart will load this state,
   and a master reset will load this file, instead of doing a
   first-time default reset.
   There is a "gotcha" with this, in that when saving the default state,
   one must \textsl{already} have set the \textbf{Start With Default State}
   switch, otherwise reloading the default state works \textsl{once}, but
   upon re-opening \textsl{Yoshimi}, the switch will be unchecked
   \textemdash that is, quite correctly in its previously saved state!

   A final detail with the history lists is that in each list type, the last
   used item will be placed at the top of the list. This is especially useful
   when wanting to continually save/load an item currently being worked on.
   However, since version 1.6.0 it has been possible to freeze these lists,
   so benefiting the (also new) MIDI NRPN control to load settings from these
   lists.

\subsection{File Compatibility}
\label{subsec:file_compatibility}

   It is always a challenge with developing software to make improvements to
   features and add new ones without breaking older versions that users might
   not be in a position to upgrade. \textsl{Yoshimi} handles this by
   retaining original file parameters with the closest match possible, and at
   the same time a separately-named new or extended parameter. This ensures
   both older \textsl{Yoshimi} versions will run correctly,
   and will do so on \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}.
   Obviously, completely new features will be lost to
   older versions but otherwise files will behave as before. This is
   especially relevant where existing files are loaded and then re-saved.

   Where there are great changes or where an entirely new concept is
   developed we create a completely new file type, but again store what is
   relevant in the older type.
\index{new!Yoshimi/ZynAddSubFX Warning}
   This has worked very well for several years. However we have come up
   against a problem. The \textsl{ZynAddSubFX} developers have taken a
   different approach, and some parameters have different types in their
   versions from 3.0 onward. Therefore we now make a test for this and give
   a warning as shown below.

%  in \figureref{fig:compatibility_warning}.

   This is known to be a problem with instrument files (.xiz) and presets
   (.xpz). We don't know if there are others. Ironically, even the latest
   \textsl{Yoshimi} versions of these files will behave correctly on
   \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}.

\subsection{Document Structure}
\label{subsec:introduction_document_structure}

   The structure of any manual is a struggle.
   There's no way to avoid jumping all over the place to
   cover a topic.  The sections are covered roughly
   in the order of the user interface of
   \textsl{Yoshimi}.  To help the reader jump around this manual, multiple
   links and an index are supplied.

   \index{tips!in document}
   Usage tips
   for each of the functions provided in
   \textsl{Yoshimi} are sprinkled throughout this manual.
   Each tip occurs in a section beginning with "Tip:".
   Each tip is provided with an entry in the Index, under the
   main topic "tips".
   \index{bugs!in document}
   Bug notes may also be found.
   Each bug occurs in a sentence beginning with "Bug:".  Each bug is
   provided with an entry in the Index, under the main topic "bugs".
   \index{new!in document}
   New features
   since the last version are flagged with "New:"  We cannot pretend to have
   marked all new developments, as \textsl{Yoshimi} is advancing fast.
   \index{todo!in document}
   To-do items are also present, in the same vein.

\subsection{Yoshimi Mailing List}
\label{subsec:introduction_mailing_list}

   The \textsl{Yoshimi} project used to have an email listserv at
   SourceForge, but the unreliability of the site has prompted a move to a
   new mailing list.  See reference \cite{yoshiminews}.  The team have
   managed to port across all the old yoshimi-user archives to this new
   site.  See reference \cite{yoshiminewsarchive}.

   Subscribe to the \textsl{Yoshimi} mailing list with an e-mail to:
   \url{yoshimi-request@freelists.org} or by visiting

\subsection{Yoshimi Licensing}
\label{subsec:introduction_yoshimi_licensing}

   \begin{quotation}
      Software licenses are are something I \textsl{really}
      don't want to get involved in - I have much better things to do with my
      time - but I found I was obliged to do so.

      It is possible I'm the only person who knows all the following events, as
      I was the one that instigated them!

      The first time I saw ZynAddSubFX source files they were licensed as GPL
      V2. At that time Zyn had a number of very serious problems, and not much
      was being done about them. Somewhat naively I asked Lars Luthman if he
      would help, as he had offered a couple of small patches previously. His
      response was that he would not do any significant work, as he did not
      agree with the GPL V2 only license.

      I then contacted Paul, explaining the situation and asking if he would
      consider a change in the license to V2 or later. I was actually a bit
      surprised that he immediately agreed. When I next looked at the sources,
      the licenses on the files had indeed been updated, so I passed this
      information on.

      Unfortunately Paul forgot to update the website, but I wasn't especially
      concerned as it was only the files themselves that really mattered.

      While developing Yoshimi after the initial fork, Cal queried the license
      situation. I told him of the conversations I'd had, and passed him a copy
      of the email I'd got from Paul. Later on, Cal - in good faith - wrote new
      sources and placed them under GPL V3. This would be quite compatible with
      V2 or later, but not with V2 strict.

      What I didn't notice until very much later was that Paul had only updated
      half of the text in the sources, leaving the actual licence in an
      ambiguous state.

      To the best of my knowledge, V3 is not compatible with V2 strict, but V2
      or later is. However the \textsl{complete}
      project then becomes downgraded to V2
      strict - although the V2 or later sources (such as all the new root/bank
      code) can independently be freely merged into V3 code.

      I doubt anyone would actually make an issue of this. However, to safeguard
      Yoshimi as a whole, I took it upon myself to change Cal's code to V2 or
      later. I believe it retains the spirit of his wishes, and the only person
      with standing to object -- his daughter - has been totally supportive of
      the work currently being done on Yoshimi.

      Any source code I add will be GPL V2 or later.
      \end{quotation}

      \textbf{Update:} The original change discussion has been located and the
      license for both Zyn and Yoshi is confirmed as GPL V2 or later. Anyone
      wanting to confirm this should look at the Zyn user list archives
      August 2007 and September 2007.


\subsection{Let's Get Started with Yoshimi!}
\label{subsec:introduction_lets_get_started}

   Let us run \textsl{Yoshimi}.
   The first
   thing to do is make sure one has no other sound application running
   (unless one wants to risk blocking \textsl{Yoshimi} or hearing two sounds
   simultaneously, depending on one's sound card and ALSA setup).
   Then start \textsl{Yoshimi}:

\begin{verbatim}
   $ yoshimi
\end{verbatim}

   If JACK is available, it will be used.  Otherwise ALSA will be used.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{2.3.3/splash.png}
   \caption{Yoshimi Splash Screen!}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_splash_screen}
\end{figure}

   One sees a brief message, or if enabled, the splash screen.
   We show the new splash screen, \figureref{fig:yoshimi_splash_screen},
   here because it only appears for four or five seconds when one runs
   \textsl{Yoshimi}! What fun is that?

   Next shown is the \textsl{Yoshimi} main window,
   as shown in \figureref{fig:yoshimi_main_screen},
   and it persists, of course:

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
%  \includegraphics[scale=0.60]{2.0/Front.png}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.60]{2.3.3/main.png}
   \caption{Yoshimi Main Screen}
   \label{fig:yoshimi_main_screen}
\end{figure}

    From \textsl{Yoshimi} version 1.5.11, the very first time Yoshimi is
    started, the main window will be overlaid with the following prompt. This
    is for the benefit of very new users who might not know where to start.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{2.3.0/firsttime.png}
   \caption{First Time Prompt}
   \label{fig:first_time_info}
\end{figure}

   Note that, if one presses the \texttt{Space} bar while the main window has
   keyboard focus The AddSynth engine of Part 1 is toggled on or off. With other windows various checkboxes are likely to be toggled. This is under investigation!

   For this manual, the main window is composed of the following sections:

\begin{enumber}
   \item \textbf{Menu}.
   \item \textbf{Top Panel}.
   \item \textbf{Effects Panel}.
   \item \textbf{Bottom Panel}.  Includes the VU-meter at the bottom.
\end{enumber}

   \index{control!reset}
   \index{reset!control}
   Starting with version 1.4.0, a right-click on any control in \textsl{Yoshimi}
   will reset the control's value to its default position.  In version 1.4.1, the \textbf{Vectors} control appears, with some minor rearrangement of the top panel.

   There's a lot going on with \textsl{Yoshimi}, with no way to describe
   it in linear order.  This manual describes how to do useful things in
   each of the sections noted above, while leaving some of the details to be
   described in later sections, to which reference can be made for the details.
   This document depends heavily on index entries and references.
   There is also a "cookbook" at \cite{book}; it is a long way from being
   comprehensive, but still has some useful tips.

   If one downloads the source code for \textsl{Yoshimi}, in the
   \texttt{examples} directory one finds a complete song set,
   \texttt{OutThere.mid} and \texttt{OutThere.xmz}. Together these produce a
   fairly complex 12 part tune that makes \textsl{Yoshimi} work quite hard.
   Also, after installing \textsl{Yoshimi}, one can find a nice, short
   introduction to \textsl{Yoshimi} in Will's document,
   \texttt{/usr/share/doc/yoshimi/The Short Yoshimi Guide.odt},
   along with a number of texts files with information that might not yet be
   present in the long manual.

   One last thing to note is that there is a list of important concepts in
   \sectionref{sec:concepts}, which one should consult if a term is puzzling.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

   In summary, we can say that you will absolutely love \textsl{Yoshimi}.
%  There are some topics that this document does not yet treat:

%  \begin{itemize}
%     \item Changing the colors and style of the GUI, as seen in some
%        versions of \textsl{ZynAddSubFX}.  This does not yet seem possible,
%        because the synth part is not truly separate from the GUI, and the
%        \textsl{Yoshimi} developers have not found it easy to recode the
%        FLTK GUI.
%  \end{itemize}

   \begin{quotation}
      A car analogy:
      A sample player is a drive along a straight, wide, almost new highway
      with only 2 other cars in sight, on a lightly overcast summer's day in a
      Ford Fiesta at around 40 MPH.
      Yoshimi is a white-knuckle trip over a Swiss mountain pass in a blizzard,
      at night, facing donkeys, trucks and bandits, while driving an open-frame
      kit car doing 90 +
      In recent times we've been able to dispose of the donkeys, and the
      bandits are on the run :)
